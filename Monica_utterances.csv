Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Chris says they re closing down the bar.
"Yeah, apparently they re turning it into some kinda coffee place."
Got me.
"Hey, did you pick a roommate?"
Rach? What are you doing?
How does she do that?
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Hi guys.
"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on."
You kissed another woman!
Hello?  Eighth street deli?
"Uh sorry, wrong number."
Hello?   It s the deli again!
"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
Because we won our apartment back!
"But, we pick again! We pick again!"
I know.
What?
"Okay, but wouldn t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Does it have to do with Joey?
Richard!
So what s up?
"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
"Well, we re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they re all either boring or annoying or y know, can t stop staring at the ladies."
"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
What?!?!
You can spill. In the sink.
"I love you, too."
About what?
My surprise party!
"Chandler, we still haven t gotten an RSVP from your dad."
Chandler! He s your father.  he should be at the wedding.
"Umm, why don't you give"
Hey!
"Oh boy, me too!"
Yeah?
"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
"Okay.  But wait, we can t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we re supposed to have lunch."
"So, are you ready to go?"
"Honey, both yours."
"When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
"Oh, um, I don t know if that s a good idea."
Why?
"What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
"Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand."
"You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game."
"Pete, can I get you something else?"
Haven t you and I covered that topic?
"Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did."
Y know what? I am
Okay.
Yes.
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
No. Ooohh
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big  ot."
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe why don t you just call her? You obviously want to.
"Well, don t  cha wanna?"
"Okay, well I do know you."
Oh my God!
"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
-leg?
What are you doing with the lamp?
Well there s some people who do want to marry me.
Yeah! Richard!
That s right.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
So?!
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Thank you!
Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
You owe me 20 bucks.
"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
"Hey, what's up?"
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
You had no relationship!!
Are you serious?  Oh my God.
Oh my God.
"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
But my apartment!
"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?"
"Well, I was having a conversation."
"Well, at least you re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party."
What?
Did that!
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Hi Chandler.
"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
"Yeah, so?"
"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Did you go home and change?
Maybe.
"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled  CUT! "
"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!"
What? We could do it!
"I can do it, okay? Come on, let s go."
"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
"And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my"
You don't even know me...
What?
"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
See?
"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you re getting me all tingly."
And did he?
"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
"Wow, I m never gonna have that feeling again, am I?"
"Okay, I m next.  Don t! Don t start another game! I said I m next! Phoebe!"
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just there s gonna be a ton left over.
"No, no! Give it to me!"
Give it to me!
I'll go in there.
"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial."
"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
Don't say it.
Really?
"Really?  My God, he s really cute."
He might still show up.
"Well y know Joey, you re a pretty charming guy."
"Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.  Uh, just a second!"
Phoebe?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Are you alone?
He s retiling my floor.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
"No! Y know,"
Do you love her?
You love her!
"Ohhh, I"
"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?"
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just  throw your purses at it."
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
"Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence  dozens of people."
No.
"Ooh, nice."
"Oh, right! I completely forgot about that."
Yeah?
Wow.
What s that?
Okay.
You wanna what?!
What are you talking about?
"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again."
What?!
Why would you do that?
Chandler!
"There was just one woman, wasn t there?"
What happened?
"Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?"
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Ahh! Aren t you dressed yet?
We re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Shoot! We re out of soda.
"I know, it is isn t it?"
"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning."
Hey.
To the bank.
Sperm.
"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135."
"Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
I can t believe we re here.
What?
"Why, what s wrong with my bathroom floor?"
I highly doubt that.
I can t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
I can t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
"Yes, you are so smart!"
I know.
"So um, who was she?"
"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
Let s get the show on it!
"I mean I m-I m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Hi!
"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it."
She s still mad.
Try feeding her again.
Phoebe! Rachel! It s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
And it kinda works out for the best.
"So, what are we gonna do today?"
"Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
Why not?
I'm not always that bad!
I punched you...?
... Phoebe...?
"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
Hi guys!
Well that s a little crazy. Although I am y know glad to hear that you re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
"Who, who are they?"
Both of them?
Which one?
"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
Do you know anything about women?
Still crying?
"Y know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex."
What did you just say?
Are you serious?!
"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!"
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
What?
You don't plan these things.
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
"I know, he s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Oh God!
Oh yeah right there!
What?! What are you doing?!
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
And Monica knows...
Light still out?
I think he's shy.
"Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!"
"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
I never let her eat.
"Oh, really?!"
"Oh, god help us."
"Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
Why would we do that?
"Okay, I'm not getting this!"
The sun is out!
Yes it has! I made cookies!
But you should eat them now because they re hot from the oven.
"Oh-ho! But not in here! Can t eat  em in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
Who?  Is that your sister?
Honey! Dinner s ready!
Your favorite!
Yep! And lot s of it!
Oh my god.
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's not really true, is it?"
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Oh!
I'm outta here.
All right.
What are you doing?
"No, only because that's the graduation song."
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
What if I asked?
Really?
He asked you out?!
Saucy!
Electrical plans for the building.
"Actually, I did!"
"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?"
"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell."
"They can t all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is."
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
He took my snack!
"Okay! Oh God, y know what? It s really bad."
"All right, that s it, we re going to the emergency room."
"The babies are asleep, I m sure you ll be okay on your own for a while!"
"Oh that s so sweet! Look Chandler I don t care if you can t cry, I love you."
Stop it!
"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!"
Joey!!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I ve gotta go make more!!
"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?"
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother s? Wouldn t they have the recipe?"
What was her name?
"Thank you soo, much."
You want some help with that?
Whoa! Are you okay?
It s the heat.  And-and the humidity.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Bye.
Now there you go! I wouldn t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Does that smell bother you?
"Well you let me know if you can, because y know I can bake a pie to cover it."
Okay!
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross s baby!
It s  It is bigger than  mine!
You can t marry him!
Well do you love him?
Sure?
I wanna wear this everyday.
Look at that! Look at that! They re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
Me neither! We have to get in!
"Oh, that s okay, I can t wait to see everything again! All of the memories"
I used to
"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile."
"Yeah!  All right, maybe you don t have to smile. Let s try something else. Let s try umm, try looking sexy."
"First of all um, I love you both so much and you re both so important to me"
"Well that s the best part. Umm,"
Because then I don t have to!
"I mean, it is so annoying."
"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
What?
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
What are you guys doing here?

"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin  me?!"

Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
"Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?"
"All right, I m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?"
Who wants it? Anybody?
"Nobody wants to do it? All right, I ll do it myself."
"Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely."
Yes.
Shhh!
"Chip, is Chip Matthews."
" Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
I m so glad you liked it.
Yes!
"How, how did that happen?"
I can't
That was a half an hour?
"It's so good, isn't it?"
I do?
You still work at the multiplex?
"Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
Nah... not-not special enough.
She s sleeping.
"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section"
"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!"
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes!
"That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?"
Pick a number! That is your
"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
"Yeah, I do think it s better this way.  Yeah, we re being smart.   Yes, I m sure."
I think you're better than you think you are.
Know when to stop.
Stop it Chandler.  I m sorry too.
Yeah! Oh yes!
"Okay,"
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
"Y know, maybe it s best that we never got to do it again."
Yeah. Where were you?
Hi.
How are you?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing"
"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
Can you do that for me?
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
I don t know how any of these got opened?!
"I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!"
Yeah. What is that?
Paris?
Keep talking.
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I ll put some out first thing in the morning."
What about these? These look the same?
Hi!
"Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier."
"Oh, honey, the earrings"
"I know that there s no hole there, I just really liked that picture."
"Okay, but there"
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Hey sweetie.
I can t tell you. It s a secret.
Awww.  But still no.
"Really? Okay, so why don t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at"
"If you tell me, I ll tell you what Phoebe said."
Okay.
Oh my God. He threw up?
"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe s old massage place is getting fired."
So then you know?
"Oh, good. Thanks."
"But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing...."
I know!!
"No, there is no way! It can"
"Well, she s not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
"Okay, I ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?"
Me neither.
"Look, I wanted to tell I m-I m sorry you lost."
Chandler please!
"I mean, what s the harm in that?"
"It was a mistake. Please don t take this to mean anything, because it doesn t."
Really?
I know! I know.
That really was some of your best work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Really?!
"How-how are you, Mom?"
What?
Nothing.
You can't!
Used to work with her. Used to! I m a relative and I didn t get invited! A
What's that supposed to mean?
We're switching rooms again.
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
"Hey Joey, come taste this."
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well   I m getting my revenge!
I officially give up.
"Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?"
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?"
Of course! Joey wouldn t let you have one?
That s it.
Hi!
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you re married everywhere.
"You see that guy? He s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he s going straight to the porn."
Yeah.
"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
Hey!
"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Thank you.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Anybody lose this?
"Okay, I ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
"Look Julio, someone left their book here."
"Oh yeah, what are you reading?"
"Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?"
Your a poet and don't know it.
"Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?"
Mine?  Right here?
"I know honey, I m sorry."
Why?
"Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
We are not going to whistle.
No!
No!
"Hi! Umm, I m Monica Geller, I m the chef at Alessandro s."
I can.
"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
Monica.
What are you doing here!
Listen Phoebe...
"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but..."
"Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
"All right, I'll try not to."
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
"I had to ask someone what it s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
"I-I-I m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
"Hi, honey."
Oh no!
"Oh please, he didn t hear it! He didn t hear it!!"
"It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
So are you thirsty?
"No, you were right. I don't have a plan."
Phoebe?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
"Well, they re just gonna have to wait aren t they? I ve only got two hands!!"
You need to give him money.
"No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin  you down. Everybody wants to be paid off."
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
"Okay, now you're even cuter!!"
What?
What are you talking about?
That's not possible!
"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
Is that all?
"Ohh, how is he?"
That s what you say about porn.
Phoebe!
Have you seen Chandler?!
How bad is this?
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can t find him anywhere!
"""Y know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""
"Hi, how are you doing Kelly?"
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
Julie.
Jody!
"And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
I never meant for you to find out!
That is not true!
Yeah!
"Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Ten dollars an hour.
Twelve dollars an hour.
What?
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
"Because he ll know what to do?  Oh my God, you re a genius!"
"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
Hey!
"Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs."
"I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me."
Hey!
"Hey, guess what I m doing tonight."
What s the charity?
Hey honey! I missed you today!
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?
"Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
"Well umm, Alexandra has been"
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
I know!!!
Okay.
What s this?
"Please, I'm not going for anything."
It s clearly an Emma.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
Look!
I bet this will work!
What?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
"Yes, you did!"
Jenny s been giving it out since they moved!
"Rachel, it s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
And it
"Yeah, sweetie."
No.
I m gonna miss you!
What?
"So you can like, bite, and pull people s hair and stuff?"
Love is the best medicine.
"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag Why is nobody writing these down?"
Hi.
"Yeah, it did."
What?
"Why, exactly?"
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than Ohhh!
It's nothing to freak out about.
"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!"
What? Honey.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I m kidding!
"Alright here s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side."
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she."
"Well, you re not."
"Yeah I can!  And don t think I don t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!"
"Of course I have! What do you think, I m some 30 year old virgin?"
"Y know, give him my flower."
"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game."
The players.
Phoebe! Come on! Let s go!  Come on!  Why aren t you dressed yet?!
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us."
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator"
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like."
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!"
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
"Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite."
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Because she s not gonna get to keep the babies.
"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila."
Gin.
Will you stop!
Hey!
"Hey, check me out, I m a slut!"
Are you okay?
"Great! It s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was"
Hi!
Hi!
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out."
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
I told you not to go down there!
Rachel always cries!
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
For what?
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
"Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!"
"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on."
Hey.
Not at these prices.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
"Okay, I got that. I ll escape over there. I ll come back over here. All right, come on"
No.
"Oh, I m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."
I just don t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
"Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!"
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but"
Why?
"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has"
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""
Why not?!
What?! You said he was sweet!
Just don t pick up your phone.
What? So now I m not allowed to fire him?
"Okay well then, I ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
Why don t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn t have to apologize.
"All right, I I have to ask."
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
"Here s Frannie. Hmm, won t she be happy to see me?"
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
"Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!"
"Ah,"
I can t find garbage bags!
What is it?!
Oh my God! Joey!
You can t marry him!
Me too!
I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we re supposed to
"Pheebs, how s it going?"
Really?!
Are you sure?
"No, you said the baby creeps you out."
You said the baby.
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?"
"I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that."
Of course!
This woman's living my life.
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
We said six!
"So big deal, so Joey s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn t mean he s great in bed."
"Well, you re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!"
Hi!
"I'm, I'm really sorry."
"Hi! Hey, Pete you re back! Hey, check this out."
Wow! You re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you re trip?
You want some coffee?
Regular or decaf?
Okay.
So what did you do today Pete?
Hi.
"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
"Oh, my mom called, they re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we re looking for a good picture of us."
"Oh, here s a great one."
"I know, but look at me: all tan."
That s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y know
Gimme them!
You stole them from me!
Mm-hmm.
Am not!
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?"
"Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people."
"Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Shut up!
"Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?"
"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
Excuse me?!
Where?
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
"Oh, god help us."
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Which?
"How, how did that happen?"
Oh my god.
"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?"
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Oh!
"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
"Alright, alright, alright..."
For what?
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
I warned you...
Hello?
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
What?
Hi!
Hi!
"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
We all chipped in.
"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?"
No I don't.
The oven is on.
"Well then get it, get it!"
Why?
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Thanks.
We are not going to whistle.
"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
Nah... not-not special enough.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Hi...May I help you?
Okay...who are you?
How's it going?
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
You can not do this.
"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
"Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?"
"Uh, you left out the stupid part."
"Come on, she'll be here any minute."
"Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?"
"Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you."
Thank you.
Monica.
"OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
What is it?
Barry who you almost...?
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
That's because I'm in front of them.
"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
'Scuse me?
What?
"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
Uh-huh.
Yo- hooo!
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Hi.
How are you?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
Not necessarily...
What?
"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial."
"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
Don't say it.
Really?
It was.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
"No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes."
Another good point.
Why isn't it working out?
Is he not cute enough for you?
What? I didn't say anything.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
How who wears it?
Demi Moore is not a he.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Oh my God!
"She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!"
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
"We were shopping, and we had lunch."
"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
No.
"Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?"
Hide the Lamp.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
"Well, thanks."
"Well, you know."
Uh-huh.
"Well no, but um."
"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . ."
"I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like."
"I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?"
"This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date."
Say you're sorry.
Say it.
"Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it."
Say you're sorry.
What're you gonna do?
"Well, bye for me too."
Great.
"Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce."
"Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it."
"Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos."
"No really, they're OK."
"Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne."
"Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me."
"Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent."
"Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?"
Where have you been?
Sorry we're late.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
I am not.
"Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up."
"Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me."
You too.
"OK, um. Goodbye."
What?
"Thanks. So, I guess I better be going."
"Wow, is that Michelle?"
"I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional."
"Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom."
"Oh, this is so hard."
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
"Joey, promise me something."
Shut up.
Did she leave a number?
"I'm not a baby, you're the baby."
"Well, maybe you don't need them."
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
And his puppet too.
Wow.
I've gotta get back in the game.
"Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too."
What?
So what happened?
"Well, how bout just her mom?"
Ok will do. So glad you came.
"Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky."
Keep talkin'.
"Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?"
"Not a basset, a bassinet."
"You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'"
"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning."
"What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman."
'I drink tea.'
"'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '"
I highly doubt that.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
"Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
You want some help with that?
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Pheebs?
Help yourself.
Phoebe moved out.
Not at these prices.
What's this?
This is not the bed I ordered!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
When did I sign for it?
Did you make brownies today?
It's Joey's birthday.
"Look Julio, someone left their book here."
Your a poet and don't know it.
Hi.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
"Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks."
Right.
"You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn."
Yeah.
Me too.
Oops.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
Oh.
Hi.
What are you smiling at?
"Yeah, right."
Hi!
"So umm, how was your date with Ginger?"
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Wow! It's small.
"So you had fun, huh?"
No.
Hey.
"Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her."
"All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel."
"Well, I was having a conversation."
Hey.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
"Ohhh, nice."
What?!
"That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!"
Oh no!!
Hey.
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
"That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest."
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
What?
What's so funny?
What the hell is this?
"Oh, this is so great."
"Hello, people who do not live here."
"He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!"
"Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
I so wanna be attracted to you.
I'm sorry.
"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
Here you go. You can wear this.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Where were you?
Yeah?
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
"Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
Huh?
You didn't even take off your pants.
"Doing great, the quiches are coming along."
Let me ask you a question.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Well?
Really?!
Yes!!
"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you..."
"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
Have you ever taken out the trash?
What?
"Sorry, Phoebe."
"No, sorry."
"Ross, cough drops, please?"
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
I was probably waiting for it to open.
You look great too.
Like a pirate?!
"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him."
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
No way!
Oh.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Haven't we made this decision?
Or! A bakery delivery person.
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it."
He asked you out?!
Electrical plans for the building.
Hi!
"I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture."
"Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!"
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
What is it hon?
Hi Phoebe.
"Yep, yep...You?"
Well...I'd better get going.
"Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?"
"OK, try this salmon mousse."
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
"Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Twelve dollars an hour.
"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
"Great, now he's waving back."
Why don't you just take it with you?
Why don't you just call her?
Joey!!
The green dress? Really?
You okay?
So'd you guys have fun?
"God, look what I found in the drain."
"God, what is wrong with me."
Oh.
Really!
"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
Let go!
"Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Hey!
"Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight."
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
I know.
Does it involve travel?
Does it involve clogs?
Clogs.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Really?!
"Nothing, I don't know."
What are you doing?!
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Thanks.
W-wait. What is that?
"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear."
I'm sorry?
All right. Mmm-mmm.
Wow.
How about Mockolate mousse?
"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
Hey.
"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served."
What?
This was your idea?
"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
What?
"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry."
"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash."
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Just waiting for you sweetie.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
What's up?
Yeah?
"Alright, go on."
"Besides, it takes the focus off the hat."
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
You're kidding?! That's great!
Yesss!!
Shhh!
"Chip, is Chip Matthews."
Hey!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
"What, that little thing at the prom?"
"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made."
Hi.
You have to go to London!
"Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold."
Phoebe?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
"Okay, ready?"
Okay.
Congratulations!
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Yeah.
I'm changing out of this.
In like a half-hour?
"Okay, throw it straight this time."
Chris says they re closing down the bar.
"Yeah, apparently they re turning it into some kinda coffee place."
Got me.
"Hey, did you pick a roommate?"
Is it the Italian guy?
It's a diaper commercial.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
What?  Why?
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
"Oh, thank you!   What s going on?"
"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna."
Okay!
"Uh sorry, wrong number."
Hello?   It s the deli again!
I don t think this number s right!
"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
"No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!"
I don t know!
What?
"Okay, but wouldn t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Does it have to do with Joey?
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
"Ohh  Oh, that s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef."
"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?"
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
"Phoebe, we re getting"
What?!?!
You can spill. In the sink.
"I love you, too."
What? I m just said.
Oh my God! I love him!
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Chandler! He s your father.  he should be at the wedding.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn t even asked?!
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
"Oh boy, me too!"
Yeah?
"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
"Okay.  But wait, we can t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we re supposed to have lunch."
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Chandler!
Yeah? The work problem?
Oh! And don t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
"You don t?  Well, that s the difference between a professional and a layman."
"No, I just I think that it s too soon."
"What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
"No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby."
"No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me."
"Pete, can I get you something else?"
Haven t you and I covered that topic?
"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
Y know what? I am
Okay.
Shut up! This place is a hole!
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
No. Ooohh
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Oh God Phoebe!!  Oh that s it! That s it! Right there! Oh!  Ooooh-oooh-ooooh
What?!
"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big  ot."
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
Me and Chandler?!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
"Great, now he's waving back."
Phoebe why don t you just call her? You obviously want to.
"Well, don t  cha wanna?"
"Okay, well I do know you."
Well so?
"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
-leg?
You actually broke her watch?
"Oh, well don t take it to the same place you took the stereo,  cause they ve had that thing for over a week."
Yeah! Richard!
That s right.
You just told me that he hates marriage!
So?!
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
"I don t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?"
Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
What musician?
"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
You had no relationship!!
"Oh God, stop with the plan!"
Why?  Cause otherwise you d go for it?
"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
But my apartment!
"You re right, you re right I shouldn t freak out."
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
"Anyway, we re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund."
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don t you?
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
That s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
That s because he wasn t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
William Sonoma
"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
Why?
"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Well?
"No, I haven't seen him."
"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?"
"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!"
What? We could do it!
"I can do it, okay? Come on, let s go."
I can t do it!
"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else."
You don't even know me...
What?
"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
Oh yeah.
See?
"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
And did he?
"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
"Oh, I haven t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler."
"No, a guy would be saying, ""I m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."""
Chandler! Phoebe s hogging the game!
"All right, you re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
Give it to me!
I'll go in there.
Phoebe come here
"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
Don't say it.
Really?
"Well,fall out of it."
"Phoebe, I m engaged!"
Is that all?
"No sweetie, you ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!"
Phoebe?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Are you alone?
All right.
"Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it."
"No! Y know,"
"Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!"
You love her!
"Ohhh, I"
"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in   I ve been watching too much porn."
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just  throw your purses at it."
"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
"Well, I m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter."
"Oh no-no-no, it s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a"
About a half an hour.
"Oh, right! I completely forgot about that."
Yeah?
Wow.
What s that?
Okay.
You wanna what?!
What are you talking about?
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
What?!
Why would you do that?
Really?
"There was just one woman, wasn t there?"
Including me?
"See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!"
What?
Oh God!
We re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Really?!
"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
I know. Thanks.
Mr. Heckles.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
To the bank.
Sperm.
"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135."
"Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
What?
What?
No!! You have been screwing us all day!
I highly doubt that.
I can t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
That s a little more than I wanted to see.
"You know that s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!"
I know.
Okay.
"Did you like her? And I m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
No.
"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it s sooo close."
I know.  I need more pie.
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
"Hello, Joey."
Hi!
"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it."
She s still mad.
"Phoebe, Sandra s mad at you too. It-it doesn t bother you?"
"I know, that s why I said again!"
For what?
"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!"
"Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
Why not?
I'm not always that bad!
I punched you...?
... Phoebe...?
I clunked your heads together!
"Four, please.  I m really nervous.  Thank you."
What are you up too?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Okay well that s good to know.
"Who, who are they?"
Both of them?
Which one?
"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
What the hell are you cooking!
That's all right.
"Y know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex."
"I don t know, I ve never had to use the other one."
Are you serious?!
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
I think so too.
I don't know.
Yeah.
"I know, he s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
"Joey, where are the"
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
"Okay, I m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots."
Oh yeah right there!
Uh Phoebe?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
"Nooo! No, that s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!"
"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
"Well, y know it s none of my business, but aren t you married?"
"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket."
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he s-he s called me up and asked me out."
"Oh, really?!"
I ll try.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
That was you?!
Why would we do that?
"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
But you should eat them now because they re hot from the oven.
"Oh-ho! But not in here! Can t eat  em in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
Okay!
"God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!"
Your favorite!
Yep! And lot s of it!
"Okay, in we go."
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's not really true, is it?"
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Oh!
I'm outta here.
Really?
What are you doing?
"No, only because that's the graduation song."
Are you sure you wanna do this?
What if I asked?
Really?
No.
Saucy!
Electrical plans for the building.
"I know that switch does something, okay?"
"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Ready?  Wrestle!
"I know, it's great!"
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
He took my snack!
"Okay! Oh God, y know what? It s really bad."
"This doesn t mean anything, does it?"
"The babies are asleep, I m sure you ll be okay on your own for a while!"
"He s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we ve got to go to the hospital."
Stop it!
"I won t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here."
Joey!!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
"Uh, wait, backstage?"
What was her name?
Nestl  Toll House?
You want some help with that?
Whoa! Are you okay?
It s the heat.  And-and the humidity.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
What do you mean?
"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
Does that smell bother you?
"Well you let me know if you can, because y know I can bake a pie to cover it."
Okay!
"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It s for you. It s the fire inspector."
What?!
You can t marry him!
Well do you love him?
Sure?
"Honey, the question is do you really want to marry Joey?"
I m so happy for me.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Oh my God! Oranges!
I used to
"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a"
"Yeah!  All right, maybe you don t have to smile. Let s try something else. Let s try umm, try looking sexy."
Or not.
"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other."
Because then I don t have to!
I m really not deciding!
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?"
What?
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
That was
...What did I ask?
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin  me?!"
Okay.
The best man? Wow!
"Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings."
We are the hottest! Huh?
"No, you're the best."
I
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
It's Danny.
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
The fake kind!
We have a ladle.
"Okay, great!"
No-no-no! We need something old!
That'll work!
"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
That's stealing!
Nope. Going to the
"No, it is me!"
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
They've arrested Monica.
I know!
Who wants it? Anybody?
"Nobody wants to do it? All right, I ll do it myself."
"You re right, I m sorry."
Okay. Sorry.
Shhh!
"Chip, is Chip Matthews."
" Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
"I know!!   Chip? Hi! It s Monica.   Kay.   Kay.  Okay.  Okay, good-bye.  Oh my God, we just had"
What?!
How much did ever really win before?
What?
That was a half an hour?
"Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the"
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
You still work at the multiplex?
"Thanks, I m set. Do you still live with your parents?"
Nah... not-not special enough.
Waaay too special.
Deep Impact
Look at this.
"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh!"
"That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?"
Pick a number! That is your
Thank you!
"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers."
I ll call you back.
Know when to stop.
"Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance."
Yeah! Oh yes!
"Listen, we don t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together."
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
What did you say?
"I m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I ll see you there in a bit?"
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
How are you?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing"
I just can't believe you're in here.
"My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally."
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
"All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard."
"I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!"
Yeah. What is that?
Hey! How d it go?
Keep talking.
I love you!
Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Um-hmm.
Not as each other!
"Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier."
"Oh, honey, the earrings"
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
"Okay, but there"
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs."
I can t tell you. It s a secret.
Awww.  But still no.
"Really? Okay, so why don t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at"
"If you tell me, I ll tell you what Phoebe said."
Okay.
Oh my God. He threw up?
"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe s old massage place is getting fired."
That s right! You lose sucker!!  Please still marry me.
"Oh, good. Thanks."
"Okay, all right don t judge me to much."
I know!!
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
He cannot play at our wedding!
Yeah.
Me neither.
What?!
Is that a secret or a lie.
Let s go big bunny!
"Chandler, please don t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel"
Really?
I know! I know.
I m gonna go tell Joey that  that you re back. I was really worried about you.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Really?!
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I ll get the furniture polish!
What?
Nothing.
"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
In the hall.
"So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?"
No it's not.
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
Chandler!
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well   I m getting my revenge!
No.
"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
Okay.
"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you re moving out?"
Pretty much.
"Joey, we have something to tell you."
Yeah!
Yeah.
Me too.
Every year.
"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
And I can't stop you.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again."
Anybody lose this?
Hmm.
"Oh, then it must ve been you. Bye."
"Oh yeah, what are you reading?"
"Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?"
Your a poet and don't know it.
"Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?"
Mine?  Right here?
"How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it."
"Gee, I don t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
Oh my God.
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
We are not going to whistle.
No!
No!
Woo-woo!
"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
Monica.
Okay.
Great!
"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but..."
This is kind of a classy place.
"See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something."
"All right, that I ll retract."
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
"Hand me those tomatoes, I m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them."
"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
"I-I-I m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
That s right.
"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!"
"Oh please, he didn t hear it! He didn t hear it!!"
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
"Fortunately, it is me."
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
This place is really my Grandmother s.
"Okay, here s your penis!"
Phoebe?
Do you have a plan?
Oh God.
No! You don t know the system! There ll be nobody messing with the system!
"No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin  you down. Everybody wants to be paid off."
You've got to be smooth about it.
"Okay, now you're even cuter!!"
What?
What are you talking about?
That's not possible!
"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
This bicep?
"Ohh, how is he?"
Isn t he an architect now?
"No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!"
Have you seen Chandler?!
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can t find him anywhere!
"Well, I m never gonna listen to you again, that s for sure!"
Well Rachel s not here!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
This is disgusting!
Jody!
"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend."
"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time."
That is not true!
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Why?!
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Ten dollars an hour.
Twelve dollars an hour.
"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you."
Ow!
"Because he ll know what to do?  Oh my God, you re a genius!"
Give it. Give it.
..Excuse me?
You made pancakes?
"I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me."
The Way You Look Tonight
"Hey, guess what I m doing tonight."
I m checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Does Ralph mumble when you re not paying attention?
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?
"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?"
"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year."
What?
"Phoebe, don t get upset!"
"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don t give out fake names."
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
What about my questions?
Okay.
What s this?
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Would you please go?
"Yeah, but I love you more."
Look!
I bet this will work!
What?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
"Yes, you did!"
You love me!
"Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together?"
"No-no, wait!"
"Yeah, sweetie."
No.
I m gonna miss you!
I know!
Oh my God!
What s fish hooking?
Why do you do it?
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
"Yeah, it did."
What?
"Why, exactly?"
Chandler that's crazy!
You are so cute!
"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!"
I'm afraid so.
"Oh God, I m so sorry."
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
It worked!
"Oh my god, I am losing my mind."
"Yeah I can!  And don t think I don t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!"
"Of course I have! What do you think, I m some 30 year old virgin?"
"Say it louder, I don t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!"
Y know what? You are right?!
The players.
"Please, it s a relief is what it is, is what it is."
"No, Phoebe, I ll tell you what, if you get ready now I ll let you play it at the wedding."
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn t cry. She wasn t angry or sad."
"Yeah, okay, give that a try!"
I'm
"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!"
Wait! What about Joey?
"Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite."
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Because she s not gonna get to keep the babies.
Wait a minute!
"Oh, she s gonna love that!"
Will you stop!
"Okay, all right, I think you re great, I think you re sweet, and you re smart, and I love you."
"Hey, check me out, I m a slut!"
Oh I can t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
"Great! It s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was"
"Y know, I don t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you re okay?"
Hi!
Hi!
"No it s not! You want it, you re gonna have to win it!"
I know I do.
Rachel always cries!
"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you ve never sucked before!"
"Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big"
"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
I warned you...
"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?"
Pants and a sweater?
"Oh, there s banana on it."
"Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy."
He's a dropper!
They re all Chandler.
"Oh, I m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."
I just don t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Are you mocking me?
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but"
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""
Why not?!
What?! You said he was sweet!
Just don t pick up your phone.
What? So now I m not allowed to fire him?
"Okay well then, I ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
"Okay well, then we ll both do it today and he ll just have to deal with it!"
"All right, I I have to ask."
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?"
Frannie was the one who found your
"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!"
"Ah,"
"Ah,"
What is it?!
I can t believe we re living here!
You can t marry him!
Phoebe!
"Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don t wanna look stupid!"
"No-no, it s not okay!"
"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler."
Are you sure?
I guess.
You said the baby.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
Of course not.
Of course!
"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit"
"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!"
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't."
We said six!
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would ve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend s such a wise ass seven!"""
"Sweetie, with you it s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great,  cause you-you guys are in love."
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant."
"Yeah, well, is that"
What?
"Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they d brighten up the place. They do don t you think?"
Relieved?
Wow! You re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you re trip?
"Oh, what d ya bring me?!"
Regular or decaf?
Okay.
So what did you do today Pete?
What?! Oh.
Ok.
Ok.
"That s not true, there are great pictures of us!"
"I know, but look at me: all tan."
That s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y know
Chandler what do you say?
You stole them from me!
Gimme them!
No.
Oh shut up!
"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
..Excuse me?
"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
"Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
"Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
Shut up!
I think he's shy.
"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
What?! You slept with Jason?
"Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
"Oh, god help us."
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Which?
"You've never met Bob, have you?"
What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Oh!
I'm outta here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
For what?
"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
I warned you...
"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
What?
I have no idea what you just said.
Hi!
Hi!
"Rach, here's your mail."
You owe me 20 bucks.
No I don't.
"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
"Well then get it, get it!"
Joey!
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Thanks.
We are not going to whistle.
No!
"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!"
Nah... not-not special enough.
Waaay too special.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Okay...who are you?
"Oh, c'mon in."
"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
"Hello, Joey."
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Burning's good.
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates."
Oh...
"Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you."
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Yes.
Hi.
"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?"
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
What is it?
Barry who you almost...?
"And Mindy, your maid of...?"
That's because I'm in front of them.
"Well, high school was not my favourite time."
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother."
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
What?
"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
Uh-huh.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Water rules!
"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
They've arrested Monica.
How are you?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
Not necessarily...
"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
Yeah.
"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
Don't say it.
Really?
"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins."
"Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
From here to the airport?
Why isn't it working out?
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
How who wears it?
Demi Moore is not a he.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
I know!
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
You had a salad.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Mmmmm.
Hide the Lamp.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
"Uh, wait, backstage?"
"Well, you know."
Uh-huh.
"Well no, but um."
"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . ."
Alright.
Yeah.
"This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date."
"Well, what made you make the exception for me?"
Say it.
"Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it."
Say you're sorry.
What're you gonna do?
You don't have the guts.
OK.
"Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing."
"Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it."
That's your call.
They'r alright.
"Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne."
I'm outa here.
"Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent."
"No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you."
"Oh, God forbid."
"No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet."
"Dr. Burke, it, it's me."
"I've been great, just great. How have you been?"
"Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up."
"Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me."
"Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment."
"OK, um. Goodbye."
What?
"Thanks. So, I guess I better be going."
Thanks again.
"I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional."
I thought she just had one.
Are we still on that?
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
"Well, I just caught the live show."
Never call me from that phone.
Cut it out.
"I don't have her number, butt-munch."
You wanna get out of my face?
"Shut up, I'm happy."
I wa-
And his puppet too.
Who?
"Weird, weird."
"Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?"
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
"Well, how bout just her mom?"
Cause I already invited her.
"Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye."
Keep talkin'.
"Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?"
"Not a basset, a bassinet."
"Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future."
"Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one."
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
"Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
"'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '"
A-ha!!!
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
"You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!"
I just asked you.
Whoa! Are you okay?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Where's your bed?
Phoebe moved out.
"Well, I think so."
"Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy."
This is not the bed I ordered!
Phoebe!
When did I sign for it?
Did you make brownies today?
"Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed."
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
"Oh yeah, what are you reading?"
Mine? Right here?
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
"Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks."
Right.
What?
Yeah.
Me too.
"Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea."
Gotta keep squishing.
"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
Oh.
No! No!
"You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire."
"Yeah, right."
I love this friend thing!
"Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad."
"Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package."
"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
"So you had fun, huh?"
No.
Hey.
"Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her."
"All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel."
"Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy."
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
How's the big anniversary dinner?
"Ohhh, nice."
What?!
"That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!"
Oh no!!
"Rachel, you and Mark?!"
"Oh, there's banana on it."
"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
"Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?"
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Ow!
Oh.
What?!
All right then. Bye.
I gave you a key for emergencies!
"Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
Two.
I'm sorry.
It's not?
Something wrong?
Uh-huh.
Phoebe?
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Wow.
"Yeah, but without the costumes."
How 'bout just a boom?
You didn't even take off your pants.
What?
"Yeah, I thought it was cute."
Why did you hire me?
"Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good."
Really?!
Yes!!
And you?
"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
Wow!
Third door on the left.
Why?
Umm.
"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
You look great too.
So how does it look?
"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him."
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
No way!
Oh.
Oh.
Haven't we made this decision?
Bye!
Pizza?!
"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
Saucy!
"I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours."
"Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?"
"Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!"
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
"Aww, honey I'm sorry."
Hormones.
Well...I'd better get going.
Could you not look?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
"Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye."
"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Ten dollars an hour.
"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour."
"Great, now he's waving back."
What kinda stuff?
Why don't you just call her?
Do you?
The green dress? Really?
Nooo!
Really?
Really?
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
I need to get some Richard.
"I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
You're not just saying that are you?
Every year.
No!
That was you?!
"Oh, please."
"Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight."
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
I know.
What?
Does it involve clogs?
Clogs.
Claws?!
Really?!
"Sweety, what are you talking about?"
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Thanks. I think you got it!
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Enough!
"No, no, I don't."
Why don't you just get a roommate?
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
I'm sorry?
Ohh.
"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that."
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
We'll put buckles on it.
"No, I'm sorry."
Oh my god good?
This was your idea?
Yeah. You!
What?
"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry."
"Well, uh, I ate some."
Cat hair.
Just waiting for you sweetie.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
I'm just easing you in.
Yeah?
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
"Oh my God, you're a freak."
"Sure, we have no money, go ahead."
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
I get the dollhouse!
"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
Oh my.
Shhh!
"Chip, is Chip Matthews."
"'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
"What, that little thing at the prom?"
"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made."
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
Emily Waltham.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Are you alone?
Okay.
Congratulations!
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Yeah.
That was a terrible throw!!
In like a half-hour?
"Okay, throw it straight this time."
I'm getting married next!!
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Chris says they re closing down the bar.
"Yeah, apparently they re turning it into some kinda coffee place."
Got me.
"Hey, did you pick a roommate?"
Is it the Italian guy?
"All right, y know what? We really are late! Let s go! Let s go! Let s go!!"
What s with all this sand?
It's a diaper commercial.
"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight."
"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
Was it...?
"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna."
Hello?  Eighth street deli?
"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
Something wrong?
"Well Ross, you be careful now. You don t want to get a reputation as y know Professor McNailshisstudents."
What?
"Okay, but wouldn t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Does it have to do with Joey?
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
Well then we still have a problem.
"Well, we re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they re all either boring or annoying or y know, can t stop staring at the ladies."
"Phoebe, we re getting"
"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
What?!?!
You can spill. In the sink.
"I love you, too."
What? I m just said.
About what?
Oh my God! I love him!
My surprise party!
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
Chandler! He s your father.  he should be at the wedding.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn t even asked?!
Hi.
Enhh
Ow!! Ow!!!
Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
"Umm, why don't you give"
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Hey!
"Oh boy, me too!"
Yeah?
"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
"Okay.  But wait, we can t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we re supposed to have lunch."
Yeah? The work problem?
"Very good,  so good."
"When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
"You don t?  Well, that s the difference between a professional and a layman."
Do you always have to bring him here?
Why?
"What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
"Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand."
"No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me."
"Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did."
Y know what? I am
Yes.
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
No. Ooohh
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
What?!
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big  ot."
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
That's
What kinda stuff?
Phoebe why don t you just call her? You obviously want to.
"Well, don t  cha wanna?"
"Okay, well I do know you."
Well so?
What are you doing with the lamp?
"Oh, well don t take it to the same place you took the stereo,  cause they ve had that thing for over a week."
Well there s some people who do want to marry me.
Yeah! Richard!
That s right.
"Honey, what s the matter?"
So?!
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
"I don t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?"
"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
You had no relationship!!
Are you serious?  Oh my God.
Why?  Cause otherwise you d go for it?
"Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
"Well, I was having a conversation."
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Did that!
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
David who?
Hormones.
That s because he wasn t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Hi Chandler.
"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
William Sonoma
"Yeah, so?"
"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
Why?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
I think I need a drink.
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Well?
"No, I haven't seen him."
Maybe.
"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!"
It s pretty clear.
"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you re getting me all tingly."
And did he?
"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
"Okay, I m next.  Don t! Don t start another game! I said I m next! Phoebe!"
"Anyway, it just doesn t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It s a lot of work."
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just there s gonna be a ton left over.
"All right, you re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
Give it to me!
I'll go in there.
"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I"
"Really?  My God, he s really cute."
"Phoebe, I m engaged!"
"Well y know Joey, you re a pretty charming guy."
"No sweetie, you ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!"
Yeah! That s why I m sleeping with him on the side.
Phoebe?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Are you alone?
I don t know. I guess the other people just don t care enough.
What s the matter?
He s retiling my floor.
"Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it."
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
"No! Y know,"
You love her!
"Ohhh, I"
"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?"
"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
About a half an hour.
"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again."
What?!
Why would you do that?
Really?
Chandler!
"There was just one woman, wasn t there?"
Including me?
Are you really gonna do this?
I am not!
No Phoebe I am mad!
"Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!"
"Wow! She is pretty, huh?"
Ahh! Aren t you dressed yet?
We re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Really?!
"I know, it is isn t it?"
"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
Mr. Heckles.
Hey.
To the bank.
Sperm.
"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135."
"Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
"Why, what s wrong with my bathroom floor?"
I highly doubt that.
I can t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
That s a little more than I wanted to see.
I can t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
I know.
"Wait, now, what am I doing again?"
"All I have is, is oregano and a"
"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it s sooo close."
"""Hi I m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I d better wash it and shrink it!"""
"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
Brides magazines?
"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
What for?
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Hi!
For what?
You al-you already had it?
Why not?
I'm not always that bad!
I punched you...?
"Oh, that s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager."
I tried to reach you at work. There s....been a fire.
"Well, the giraffe s okay. And so is the pirate."
"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
Hi guys!
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
"Who, who are they?"
Both of them?
Which one?
"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
Do you know anything about women?
That's all right.
Still crying?
"Y know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex."
"Oh, we have some"
"Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
Are you serious?!
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
"Yeah, you want some?"
What?
"I know, he s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Oh God!
Oh yeah right there!
Uh Phoebe?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
We have one.
"Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!"
"Well, y know it s none of my business, but aren t you married?"
"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
"Oh, really?!"
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
That was you?!
Why would we do that?
The sun is out!
"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
Yes it has! I made cookies!
But you should eat them now because they re hot from the oven.
"Oh-ho! But not in here! Can t eat  em in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Is someone there?
Who?  Is that your sister?
"God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!"
Your favorite!
Yep! And lot s of it!
"Okay, in we go."
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's not really true, is it?"
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Oh!
I'm outta here.
Really?
What are you doing?
"No, only because that's the graduation song."
What if I asked?
Really?
No.
He asked you out?!
Saucy!
Electrical plans for the building.
"Actually, I did!"
"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
"I know, it's great!"
He took my snack!
"Okay! Oh God, y know what? It s really bad."
"Joey, you know you don t actually have one."
"The babies are asleep, I m sure you ll be okay on your own for a while!"
"He s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we ve got to go to the hospital."
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
"Oh that s so sweet! Look Chandler I don t care if you can t cry, I love you."
Stop it!
"I won t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here."
"All right, sorry."
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Where?
"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother s? Wouldn t they have the recipe?"
What was her name?
Nestl  Toll House?
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
"Oh, why is it unfair?"
"Joey, that paper s like a year old!"
"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
"Thank you soo, much."
Whoa! Are you okay?
It s the heat.  And-and the humidity.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
"Joey, why don t you put them in the lost and found?"
Does that smell bother you?
"Well you let me know if you can, because y know I can bake a pie to cover it."
Okay!
"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It s for you. It s the fire inspector."
You can t marry him!
Well do you love him?
Sure?
"Honey, the question is do you really want to marry Joey?"
I m so happy for me.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Oh my God! Oranges!
"Yeah!  All right, maybe you don t have to smile. Let s try something else. Let s try umm, try looking sexy."
"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!"
"First of all um, I love you both so much and you re both so important to me"
"Well that s the best part. Umm,"
I m really not deciding!
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?"
What?
That was
What are you guys doing here?
"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin  me?!"
Okay.
So have you called her yet?
Phoebe and Gary are
We are the hottest! Huh?
"No, you're the best."
Hey!
"I don't know, clean places?"
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
No-no-no! We need something old!
That'll work!
"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
That's stealing!
Water rules!
Nope. Going to the
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Who wants it? Anybody?
"Nobody wants to do it? All right, I ll do it myself."
Okay. Sorry.
" Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
"I know!!   Chip? Hi! It s Monica.   Kay.   Kay.  Okay.  Okay, good-bye.  Oh my God, we just had"
What?
That was a half an hour?
"Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the"
"It's so good, isn't it?"
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Nah... not-not special enough.
"No, you messed it up. You re stupid."
She s sleeping.
Deep Impact
Look at this.
"That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?"
Pick a number! That is your
Thank you!
"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him."
I think you're better than you think you are.
Know when to stop.
"Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance."
Hi.
Stop it Chandler.  I m sorry too.
Yeah! Oh yes!
"Listen, we don t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together."
This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
"Okay,"
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
What did you say?
"I m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I ll see you there in a bit?"
I know!
"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
"I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!"
Yeah. What is that?
Hey! How d it go?
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
Paris?
Keep talking.
Not as each other!
Hi!
"Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier."
"Oh, honey, the earrings"
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
"Okay, but there"
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
I can t tell you. It s a secret.
Awww.  But still no.
"Really? Okay, so why don t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at"
"If you tell me, I ll tell you what Phoebe said."
Okay.
Oh my God. He threw up?
"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe s old massage place is getting fired."
What was it for?
Wow!
"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
No.
So then you know?
"Oh, good. Thanks."
I know!!
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
"Okay, I ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?"
What?!
Is that a secret or a lie.
Chandler please!
Let s go big bunny!
"Chandler, please don t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel"
"It was a mistake. Please don t take this to mean anything, because it doesn t."
Really?
I know! I know.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Really?!
You can't!
"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and   You go."
"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
We're switching rooms again.
Hey-hey.
Hey!
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well   I m getting my revenge!
That is true.
It might be kinda cool.
"Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?"
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
Of course! Joey wouldn t let you have one?
"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you re moving out?"
Pretty much.
Hi!
"Joey, we have something to tell you."
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you re married everywhere.
Yeah!
Hey!
"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
And I can't stop you.
"Joey, what are you doing?"
"Joey, do you work here?"
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again."
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
"Okay, I ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
"Oh, then it must ve been you. Bye."
"I know honey, I m sorry."
"Gee, I don t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
Why?
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
We are not going to whistle.
No!
No!
Woo-woo!
What are you doing here!
Great!
Listen Phoebe...
"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but..."
This is kind of a classy place.
"Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
Great. So the ball is in his court?
"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
"All right, I'll try not to."
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
How's it going?
"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!"
"No, you were right. I don't have a plan."
Do you have a plan?
I see pizza!
What?!
"Aww, thank you."
And who laminated it?
"Well, they re just gonna have to wait aren t they? I ve only got two hands!!"
"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let s stock up."
You need to give him money.
"No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin  you down. Everybody wants to be paid off."
You've got to be smooth about it.
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that s Scottish like you are.
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
"Okay, now you're even cuter!!"
What?
What are you talking about?
That's not possible!
"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
This bicep?
That s what you say about porn.
"No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!"
Have you seen Chandler?!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can t find him anywhere!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
This is disgusting!
What? I didn't say anything.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
Jody!
"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
That is not true!
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Ten dollars an hour.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Really?!
"We could, or we can have sex in it."
"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
"Because he ll know what to do?  Oh my God, you re a genius!"
Give it. Give it.
The
..Excuse me?
You made pancakes?
"Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs."
"I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me."
"Hey, guess what I m doing tonight."
I m checking out the restaurant with Pete.
What s the charity?
Does Ralph mumble when you re not paying attention?
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?
What?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
"Well umm, Alexandra has been"
"Phoebe, don t get upset!"
"Rachel, how did this happen?"
"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don t give out fake names."
"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
I know!!!
Okay.
What s this?
Not one that can pee on the roof.
I don t want a ghost.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
Look!
I bet this will work!
What?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
"Yes, you did!"
You love me!
Huh?
"Yeah, sweetie."
No.
I m gonna miss you!
What?
Oh my God!
"Oh wait, Joey, you can t go like that! You stink!"
What s fish hooking?
Isn t that mine?
"Ross, we can handle this."
Love is the best medicine.
Why do you do it?
Yes.
Hi.
"Yeah, it did."
What?
"Why, exactly?"
"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!"
I'm afraid so.
"Oh God, I m so sorry."
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
It worked!
"Umm, she Rach, not it, she."
"Yeah I can!  And don t think I don t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!"
"Of course I have! What do you think, I m some 30 year old virgin?"
Y know what? You are right?!
Rachel! I m never gonna think it s okay for you to cheat on your husband!
"I know! Hey, how s Chandler doin ?"
"What, he doesn t like Josh?"
"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
"No, Phoebe, I ll tell you what, if you get ready now I ll let you play it at the wedding."
Hi.
"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like."
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!"
"Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite."
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Because she s not gonna get to keep the babies.
Will you stop!
Hey!
"Hey, check me out, I m a slut!"
Oh I can t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Are you okay?
"Great! It s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was"
"Y know, I don t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you re okay?"
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out."
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
What is the worse part?
For what?
"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
"Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!"
"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on."
Hey.
Then why are you smoking?
Not at these prices.
"Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy."
That s not your regular dry cleaners.
What?!
"Don t worry Phoebe, you re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you."
"Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?"
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
They re all Chandler.
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can t see this.
No.
"Oh, I m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."
I just don t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Are you mocking me?
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but"
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.
Why?
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""
Why not?!
What?! You said he was sweet!
Just don t pick up your phone.
What? So now I m not allowed to fire him?
"Okay well then, I ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
"Okay well, then we ll both do it today and he ll just have to deal with it!"
Why don t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn t have to apologize.
"All right, I I have to ask."
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?"
"Here s Frannie. Hmm, won t she be happy to see me?"
Frannie was the one who found your
"Oh, come on."
What is it?!
You can t marry him!
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn t have a baby in nine months!
There s a dude?
Why do you want to see my hand?
Me too!
About what?
What?! You re crazy! There s nothing sexual about the noises I make!
"Oh my This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I m never gonna get massaged again!"
Really?!
Are you sure?
I guess.
"No, you said the baby creeps you out."
You said the baby.
What?! Excuse me!
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?"
Of course!
"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he s gonna call you again."
This woman's living my life.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
We said six!
"So big deal, so Joey s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn t mean he s great in bed."
"Sweetie, with you it s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great,  cause you-you guys are in love."
Y know what? It
"Well, you re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
Phoebe!
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late."
"Yeah, well, is that"
What?
Hi!
"I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew."
"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
"Oh, my mom called, they re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we re looking for a good picture of us."
"That s not true, there are great pictures of us!"
"Oh, here s a great one."
That s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y know
You stole them from me!
Mm-hmm.
"Oh, why is it unfair?"
..Excuse me?
"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
"Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
"Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
"Ah, the other Jack."
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Shut up!
"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
What?! You slept with Jason?
"Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
"Oh, god help us."
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Which?
"You've never met Bob, have you?"
What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Oh!
"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
What?
I have no idea what you just said.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
"Rach, here's your mail."
No I don't.
"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
Joey!
Why?
We are not going to whistle.
Woo-woo!
"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
Nah... not-not special enough.
What are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
How's it going?
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
"Hello, Joey."
No.
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Thank you.
"Uh, you left out the stupid part."
"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates."
"Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you."
Monica.
Hi.
"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
What is it?
Barry who you almost...?
This woman's living my life.
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
What?
"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
Yeah.
"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
What's with the guitar?
Why isn't it working out?
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?
Is there? Is there someone else?
What? I didn't say anything.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
How who wears it?
Demi Moore is not a he.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Oh my God!
"We were shopping, and we had lunch."
You had a salad.
"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
No.
Hide the Lamp.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
"Well, you know."
Uh-huh.
"Well no, but um."
"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . ."
"Ross, the heat!"
Well put it back.
"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish."
"Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself."
Say it.
"Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it."
Say you're sorry.
What're you gonna do?
You don't have the guts.
I am not.
"Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up."
"Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me."
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
"Well, I just caught the live show."
Shut up.
Cut it out.
Did she leave a number?
They won't take you to the vet.
Hey.
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
I wa-
Who?
His indian name?
Why?
I've gotta get back in the game.
"Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?"
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Ohh!
"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
"What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman."
"Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
'I drink tea.'
"'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '"
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
I just asked you.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Phoebe moved out.
Not at these prices.
This is not the bed I ordered!
When did I sign for it?
"Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed."
Um-mm.
It's Joey's birthday.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
"No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet."
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
"Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package."
Wow! It's small.
"So you had fun, huh?"
Hey.
"Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her."
"All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel."
"Well, I was having a conversation."
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
How's the big anniversary dinner?
"Ohhh, nice."
What?!
"That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!"
Oh no!!
Hey.
"Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
Then why are you smoking?
Oh.
Two.
Something wrong?
Uh-huh.
Phoebe?
"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
"Yeah, but without the costumes."
Huh?
You didn't even take off your pants.
What?
"Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good."
Hi.
Really?!
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Third door on the left.
"Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold."
What?
Why?
"Sorry, Phoebe."
"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
Haven't we made this decision?
Bye!
Or! A bakery delivery person.
Pizza?!
"Boy, you are really not a morning person."
"Very good, so good."
Hi!
"Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!"
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
"Aww, honey I'm sorry."
Hi Phoebe.
Hormones.
Well...I'd better get going.
Could you not look?
"Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?"
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Ten dollars an hour.
"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour."
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
What kinda stuff?
"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
Why don't you just take it with you?
Why don't you just call her?
The green dress? Really?
Really?
No!
That was you?!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
"Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight."
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
I know.
Does it have to do with Joey?
Does it involve clogs?
Clogs.
What is it?! What about Pete?
Really?!
Hey.
What are you doing?!
Enough!
Why don't you just get a roommate?
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
Oh my god good?
"Sure, we have no money, go ahead."
"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
"'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
"What, that little thing at the prom?"
"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made."
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Hi.
Hey!
"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
Phoebe?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Okay.
Congratulations!
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Yeah.
That was a terrible throw!!
In like a half-hour?
"Okay, throw it straight this time."
I'm getting married next!!
