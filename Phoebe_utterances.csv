"Oh, it has a name?"
"I licked my arm, what?"
You won't even taste it?
What?!
"Ross, where did you get this?!"
"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
"I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
"Oh, I ll get it."
Hey!
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It s so beautiful.
"So, I m here, ready to play."
"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha."
"That s a dog, every house should have a dog."
"Well, maybe it s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
"No, no, that s the ghost for the attic."
"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
"Watch, watch."
"Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing."
"Well, what period is it from?"
Did they tell you anything?
 Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.  You just wrote this!
Ohh!
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
"Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you."
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
"So, um, have you told your parents?"
"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better."
Can I tell you a little secret?
Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
Sure! I feel so bad for you. I broke my leg once too.
"Uh-huh, yeah."
"Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That s my Dad, that s Frank! Yeah! I m sorry I m getting all flingy."
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks."
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I ve been, I ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything."
"I m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out."
"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?"
"Umm, thank you for meeting with me."
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
That's always fun to be.
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Hey!
"Yeah, she was bald, she s not now."
"I don t know, I hardly ever say that about people."
"Well I m sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
"Well, maybe it won t work out. Maybe Ross won t like her personality."
"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice s ex-husband, that s like betraying Chandler."
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
Oh there it is.
"I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store"
When I get up there I m going to kick some ass.
What?
"Oh yeah well, I m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?"
A little.   Now you re talking.
I-I-I d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
"Hey, you guys. Listen, I m sorry that I was hogging the game before  Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!"
But
"Okay. Okay, but you can t fire him today."
Because I m dumping him today.
He
"Then he comes over!  ""I m so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!"
"You can t fire him and dump him the same day, he ll kill himself."
"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I ll kill"
Hey! So how was the doctor?
Good.
"And umm, he s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive."
Thank you.
"Oh, ew!"
"Because I can, and my Mom couldn t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad."
"Yeah, yeah. You can do it to."
You completely stole my answer!
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers."
Hell yeah! I ll marry you!
Hey!
It s Joey!
Who? Who is it?
Was that story over?
"Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!"
Oh and I need to talk to you.
Hi!
"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on."
I mean hi.
"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!"
"Well not clients, lovers. But let s just y know, try it again. Come back and-and we ll work through it."
Yes.
"You guys, I m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?"
"Yeah, it s about relationships. Y know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!"
Yeah?
"Oh, how did it go?"
"Yeah, maybe."
Hi!
I know what time you said.
"Well, what did he do?"
Are you sure? I ll bet there s another flight to Minsk in like
That s really beautiful. What does it mean?
"That s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else."
You re right! You re right. Don t say it.
I do too.
"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay."
That s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won t open.
Fish!
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here"
"We did have fun, didn't we?"
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
"Yay, okay!"
No. But thanks.
"Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!"
"Did you, did you"
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
"Hey, why don t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer."
"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato."
"Hey, Lizzie."
"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
I know.
"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
"Oh, that's fine, no."
"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
You are just like Jack.
"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
Floopy?
Uh-huh.
"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
You'd already broken up.
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
"Yeah, it was really hard."
Wait here. Breathe.
It's like a gift.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
"Oh, that sucks!"
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
We should do something. Whistle.
Do it do it do it!
Maybe nobody's tried this.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Hi.
"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta."
"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
Fine!
Hey.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Intense and creepy.
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
Wherere you going?
With?
Yeah. Okay.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
Really?
"Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
Yeah?
"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
Ross says hi.
"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
"No, but you can't."
"All right, that's it, I quit."
"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Demi Moore.
"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
Oh. Oh!
"Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that."
You wanna do it right now?
What?
"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
Hi.
Ta-da.
OK.
"Oh, right, OK. Ole."
Ohh. . .K. How come?
What?
Huuh.
"Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?"
Thank you.
"So, I figured it out."
Hey Joey.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did."
And we did.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
"Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?"
"OK, is this really my father?"
"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
Oh.
"Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math."
"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know."
Hey.
OK.
Mailbox.
"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
Yeah.
"OK, hi again."
Fired! Why?
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Stick a fork what?
"Oh, some guy she met at the movies."
"Hang in there, it's gonna happen."
You are so smitten.
"Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out."
So. You two are totally into each other.
"OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?"
"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?"
"Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went."
No.
"Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK."
Hey.
Hey.
"Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video."
I mean this poor woman.
"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody."
Monica.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
"Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date."
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
"Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him."
"All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again."
What?
"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward."
"Oh, you're not a dingus."
"Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?"
"Oh, yeah. What's this?"
Really?
"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister."
"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
Two?
Helloo! Oh!
"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent."
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
Oh.
"Yeah, no, I understand."
Yeah. Sorry.
What?
Hey!
"Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad."
"Yeah, yeah. You can do it to."
"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that...."
Feburary 16th.
"Wow, that's close. When's yours?"
"Okay so, by melting, you meant melting."
"Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?"
"Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache."
"G'night, bro."
I just asked you.
"Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!"
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
"Hey, you're early."
"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
You don't play the oboe!
Oh no! Why?
"Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler."
"I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?"
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
"I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it..."
It's Monica's bed. What?
"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now."
Oh! Oh my God!
"Ick, you were eavesdropping."
"Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?"
"No, I can spot you from here."
"Umm, I think you're really, really great..."
"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before."
"It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know."
"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault."
"Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?"
"Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!"
See there it is right there.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?"
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other."
Hey!
"Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up."
"Yeah, what town are we near?"
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
"So, you're like a zillionaire?"
"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."
"Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman..."
It isn't?
Thanks!
"Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just..."
Uh.
"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
Yeah.
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
"Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
"""Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..."" Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show."
Hey!
Oh?!
"Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look."
"Okay, I didn't hear that."
Hey!
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Oh.
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Really?!
What?!
"Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!"
"But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice."
"No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?"
"Yeah, all right."
What?!
I wa-I wa-I wa...
"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
"So now, what is this now?"
And this?
"Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant."
"Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!"
"I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No."
Pastrami.
"Hm-mm, corn beef."
Okay.
Six months.
Hey!
"Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
"I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!"
Thank you so much.
Hello.
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
Oh! You have a window!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
How's this?
Sorry. How about over here?
"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?"
What about this?
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
"Oh my God, they took my idea!"
"Yeah! Okay, here you go."
Hey!
What?
"Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
No.
Noo!
"Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?"
No!
Hey what are you guys looking at?
"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry..."
"So, did you pick one yet?"
"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
"Okay, alright, I have a question, then."
"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying."
Hello?
Hi.
"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!"
So-so you're really not going?
Oh don't do that.
Oh no no.
"Oh, but I can't do that-"
"It's your thing, and-"
"Okay, um, stay."
"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y."
"Yeah? Are you sure, really."
"Hey Ryan, what's up?"
"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox."
"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now."
Please.
I got it.
"No, no, it's just my tooth."
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
"No, just a barrel."
Hey!
"Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!"
"Look, look!"
"The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed."
"Watch, watch."
Hey!
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Ohh. What is this?
Ooh! Hi!
"Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay."

"No-no, let me in!"

"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed."
Thanks.
"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
Uma Thurman.
But I can t tell you.
"Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn t tell, and I swore to like all my gods."
No.
No.
"No, but let s come back to that later!"
That sounds great!
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
No! No! It s-it s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
What?! No! It was my idea!
"Yeah, I would ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
"Okay, this is what I m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill."
"Aw, honey it s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don t see that happening."
"Aww, good.  What?"
"No you re not, you re wondering which cushion it is."
"Ok, you weren't there."
Yeah.
Jason is not a sissy!
What surprise party?
"Well, he didn't tell me."
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Yuh-huh!
Not after this!
I thought you said you read it in high school.
"Hey, how'd it go?"
Ok.
"I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
"Remember, a virgin for me please."
That and arrogance.
"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don t know what the big deal is!"
I m sorry.
"Great, let s begin.  How s the pressure?"
"Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it s not weird is it."
"That s right, you just enjoy."
Okay.
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? I m sorry.
You think you know me so well.
Yeah.
That s what I said.
I can t.
"No, I got in trouble for that before. I ll see you later."
"Hey, you re early."
I m just taking it to be re-wired.
"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
You don t play the oboe!
"I may play the fool at times, but I m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won t quit."
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Really? Are you sure?
"Okay, sorry. Yeah."
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
"Well, you promised me a fun road trip!"
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Sing!!
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Ta-da.
Hi.
"Do I? Thank you, so do you."
Sparkly.
"Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo."

We could have breakfast in bed
Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
"Oh, yeah!"
"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no."
"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I d be a millionaire by now, y'know."
Left!  Thank you.
Ross!
Yeah absolutely!
"Okay, so I"
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven t been able to say two words to each other."
That would be great. Thank you.
Grasp one of the linen strips by its  easy grab tab  and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Was it not pain-free?
"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don t seem to think it s that bad."
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!"
"Oh, you say someone s name enough, they turn around."
David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren t you supposed to be in Russia?
Well  Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yeah.
Exactly!
"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,"
"Ok, that'll be great!"
"All I could think of was y know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
"I m a lady Monica, I don t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself."
I just like him so much that I just feel like I ve had 10 drinks today and I ve only had six.
"Oh, I m sorry. I didn t hear you over all the winning."

"Yeah, well, don t  Aww Pheebs, that sucks!  me yet."

"Well, are any of those people here?!"
"Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?"
"Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I m-I m mad at you."
"Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I m kinda hungry."
"All right, stop it. Now you re just doing it to freak me out."
Go for it.
"I m just saying, get his number just in case."
"Y know what? I m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!"
Do you like car games?
I
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
You told me.
"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn t been on the toilet."
Yeah!
I know. They were mine.
"No, it s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on."
I m wearing his briefs right now.
And! Y know what Jake says? That women s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
I m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women s underwear!
"Okay, whatever."
I don t know.  A cowboy theme?
"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
Chandler?
She was?
"Okay, whatever."
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
"No, you have to let me in right now!!"
Yes!
"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it s like  Is it on the lose?   Is it watching me? "
"No, I can spot you from here."
"Okay, listen Robert..."
"Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"
"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
"Well, it s just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
"Yeah, it s for our catering business!"
"And also, we don t know what to do with this."
Not
Me too! So happy for them!
Totally. I m like 90/10.
"Well, I ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note."
Oh that s a nickname we were trying out.
So what?! That doesn t give you the right to ditch me!
Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?
Why?
What sex?
We didn t have sex.
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
"Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!"
"Oh, come on!"
"Well, deep-deep-deep down!"
Then keep running.
I'm sorry.
"See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!"
"No. I m just, I wanna, I need to be alone."
"Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes    the hand just slips!"

Wait here. Breathe.
It's like a gift.
"Oh, I'd like that."
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine."
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.
Intense and creepy.
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.

"Phoebe.  Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess."
"Aw, dammit!"

"All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that s easier to rhyme?"
You gotta go!
"Okay, don t worry. You re ready."
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you ll be great.

"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It s over!"
Some guy bought it. I m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
The little jail between the doors!
"I know, I m sorry! But y know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring."
Maybe it was the guy.
"No-no, it ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!"
What? He s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
I m so glad you could make it.
"Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
We ruined everything.

"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?"
"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
You mean a backup?
"Yeah, yeah I got that."
Hm-mmm

"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal."
Nothing..Why?
Oh yeah it is! I m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
"Oh, I m sorry. I m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?"
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah!
"Ooh, now you lost me."

"Well, he made a move on me."
"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental."
Destiny.
Yes.
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn t look very fulfilled.
"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
"So, what happens to the old guys?"
"Why, do I have a feeling that s not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!"
Ohh! You made up!

Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
But you-you can t leave me with them! We-we re a team! We re playing a zone! They re gonna triple team me!
"But no, because a doctor won t be able to help him, it s just gonna y know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
I m pretty sure it s gun.
"A real man wouldn t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?"
I
Right- where we've been looking all night!
"I m just saying, this woman, I mean she s fictitious. No?"
 Cause you re still into Monica.
"Yeah, no, I m fairly intuitive and psychic. It s a substantial gift."
"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
"No I m serious. I mean I m intuitive, but my memory sucks."
Thanks.
"Well, y know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
Nestley Toulouse.
"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you re burning in hell!!
Probably?
"He s awfully short and I think he s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he s not that good in bed."
"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy."
Oh absolutely yeah!
"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a"
"What the smell from Joey s? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
Okay.
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
Oh my God Monica!
Wash your hands!!!
Not if you were here.
Still.
Wh-why is that the best part?
Maybe on some level.
"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?"
That s it! 25 percent? That means that s it s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Wow! You guys really don t know anything!
"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from"

And this is Rachel.

"Oh, okay."
"Ohh, you and your ways.  Since it s Christmastime. I m going to be one of those people collection donations."
"Yeah, yeah, I m going to be out there spreading joy to the people."
No! No! Look at that!  It s a line of ants! They re working as a team!
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Uh-huh.
What?!
"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
"Oh, I m flaky. I ll say anything."
"Oh, come on! I think he s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk."
"You mean the Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."
"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y know, real  nice and tight."
Oh.
No!
What?
Uh-huh.  Good luck.
"Oo, where are the seats?"
"Oh, then no."
But she just came up here!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Would you stop that!
"Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her."
Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
What are you doing?
Oh! You got it?!
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me."
"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?"
What are you saying I should do?
"Thank you, Monica."
"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail."
Now what is Fabutec?
God. Do think it really doesn t hurt?  Cause how can they do that?
They have the best stuff in there.
"Ok, are they listening?"
Where were you?
I don t know.  Me neither.
"Look, I m talking right now! You re you mean her."
What?!
No!!
Are you moving out?
"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,"
"Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me."
"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
Which proves that I never lie.
Paolo made a pass at me.
So did Heldi show you the place?
I can t believe you re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Did I use that already today? I m sorry.
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Works on you.
I could ve been killed I hope you know!
"Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
What?!  What the hell?!
"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
Okay Ross!  Please don t die!
"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
"Wait a second! So, what s new with you?"
Okay.
What?!
Oh my God!
Wow! You do?
All right.
I
"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not"
"Oh, I wouldn t miss this."
"Oh, you re such a gentleman.  Come on! We re going to my place!"
Hi!
"Oh this, well I m glad you asked."
"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan."
"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he s gay."
Really?!
"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl s gotta eat."
"Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!"
"Okay, y'know what, you don t have to do that now."
Don t you see? Everyone s looking at me! The plan s working! I didn t even have to take off my top yet!
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.
"Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree."
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!"
Hi!
Uh-huh.
Why else would I be here?
You didn t notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y know what? This is too weird.
"Yeah, so do you."
"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
"Well,"
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
And a small piece of chocolate.
"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what s he like. People tell doctors everything."
Really?!
Oh my God! Eh! Well
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
So go fix it!
"Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!"
What?! What do you mean you re going to London?
No!
"I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I m carrying a litter."
Are you all right?
Oh my God! He did it?
Are you kidding?
"I just talked him into it, don t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people."
"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so."
Especially Ross!
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
You didn t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Bye-bye!  That s why I moved out.
I think on some levels she already knows.
"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
We should do something. Whistle.
"Come on, do it."
Do it!
Do it do it do it!
I can't believe you did that!
"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!"
Yeah!
Yeah.
But what?
"Ok, say no more."
What are you doing?
To kill Bob??
"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!"
"I'll find Bob, I'll get him."
"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
"Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
Suzie
Nothing!   This is not over!
What?!
Ohh!
Okay.
"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!"
"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place."
"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place."
"Yeah, I've been around."
"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees."
"Oh, I can't believe it!"
How could it not be?
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
"Ooh, I love that place!  So, no."
Enh. Sure!
"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!"
Thank you.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
"God, what a mess."
I don't even have a 'pl'.
"Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!"
"Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor."
Shh!
I ate a bug.
"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don t know where we are, so we can t get a tow truck."
"Yes, please."
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice."
"Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him."
On the touchy.
"No, I know!"
All in good time my love.
What?! They took mine to give to you!
"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
These
Why not?
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
"Oh right, because you re so capable of change."
"And y know, even if they break up again, you d better not let him in your sad men s club!"
No! Why?
What are you gonna do?
"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one."
Oh no! Why?
"Oh my God! I don t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
I m sorry.
"Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person."
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
What?! Well he never said that to me!
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
"Don t worry about me, I m a robot! I m just a machine!!"
Oh my God.
I am
"No, I mean I was really acting my ass off."
"Oh yeah, you re solid. Yeah, you re just no me."
Fine!
"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
Hi Monica!
What?
"Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he s changed his name, y know? Tell Monica I m sorry."
Don t be so negative! Good God! Isn t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!
I want to see what he wants first.
Then do Iceberg!
G
"No, but you're questioning my method!"
"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
"Oh, fine! Take his side!"
"I just can t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?"
"I m sorry, for the last time, why aren t you two together again?"
"Yeah that s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer."
Right.  Or you might get everything you ve wanted since you were fifteen.
"No, no, he hasn't been around."
Minsk?
I know where Minsk is.
"So when, when do you leave?"
"Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!"
"Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later."
"Oh, it has a name?"
Okay Oop! Too late! I m leaving! Come on Chandler let s go!
So?
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
"Ross, where did you get this?!"
"Wow! Oh my God, well if they ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!"
"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good."
"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in."
"Relax, it s not like we re forking."
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It s so beautiful.
"So, I m here, ready to play."
"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha."
"That s a dog, every house should have a dog."
"Well, maybe it s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
"No, no, that s the ghost for the attic."
"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
"Okay, obviously you don t know much about the U.S. government."
"And, and!"
"Well, what period is it from?"
"Yes, yes I do."
"White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place."
Noooo!!
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted."
"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
Okay!
I am
Here you go.
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
I want to keep one.
Sure! I feel so bad for you. I broke my leg once too.
"Well, it s a long story."
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks."
"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I ve been, I ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything."
"Oh, what? What was it?"
Really?!
It's okay to laugh right?
"Come, sit."
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
You betcha!
"Yeah, but they didn't ask me!"
No I'm not.
Hey!
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
"I don t know, I hardly ever say that about people."
"Well I m sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
"Well, maybe it won t work out. Maybe Ross won t like her personality."
"Oh no, Bonnie s the best!"
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
"Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler s your friend...  Oh!"
"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one."
A new grocery store.
"Yeah, we both can. And we both will."
"Oh yeah well, I m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?"
A little.   Now you re talking.
I-I-I d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
She must ve left.
Chandler sucks! He couldn t have gotten this good!
"Okay. Okay, but you can t fire him today."
Because I m dumping him today.
He
"Then he comes over!  ""I m so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!"
"You can t fire him and dump him the same day, he ll kill himself."
"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I ll kill"
Okay. But the question is who s gonna go first.  Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
Good.
Oh.
"Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?"
No!
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.
"Yeah, yeah. You can do it to."
"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can t. We don t have that...."
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers."
Would
"Hey lady, your day s over! It s my turn!"
It s Joey!
We don t know.
Was that story over?
Oh my God! I know who the father is
I wanna see what s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
To see if know what these guys are talking about.
"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today."
There s nothing sexual about this?
"No, you can t let this stop you from getting massages!"
"Well not clients, lovers. But let s just y know, try it again. Come back and-and we ll work through it."
Yes.
"Great! Okay, if you ll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?"
"Yeah, it s about relationships. Y know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!"
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
Yeah.
What did he say?
Any luck?
I know what time you said.
"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said."
Joey!
That s really beautiful. What does it mean?
"That s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else."
You re right! You re right. Don t say it.
I do too.
"Okay, now s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow."
"If you would ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he s probably not gay."
No that s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here"
"We did have fun, didn't we?"
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
"Yay, okay!"
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
Okay. No. But thanks.
"Did you, did you"
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Then don't touch one!!
"Yeah that s great! Next to that, Chandler won t look so stupid."
Okay!
I brought you alphabet soup.
I know.
"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
"Oh, that's fine, no."
"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
Okay.
"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
Floopy?
"Oh, like that's a word."
"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
You'd already broken up.
A couple hours.
"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
"Ok, have a good break-up."
"Ok, you weren't there."
It's like a gift.
"Oh, I'd like that."
Wait a minute. What's his name?
You betcha!
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
"Where? Ooh, come to Momma."
"Come on, do it."
I can't believe you did that!
"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic."
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
"No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
Sorry.
"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
So what's going on?
Intense and creepy.
"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
With?
"Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
But hes falling in love with her.
"Listen, um..."
"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me."
Yeah. Oooh...
"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
"Oh. Uh, I'm on."
Ross says hi.
"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
All right. Bye bye.
"No, but you can't."
Uh uh.
"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Demi Moore.
"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
Oh. Oh!
Oh my God!
You wanna do it right now?
"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
Nah. Not really.
"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope."
Ta-da.
Hi.
"Oh, right, OK. Ole."
"Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha."
What?
Huuh.
"I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties."
Sure.
Really? From who?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did."
And we did.
Yay me.
"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them."
"Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?"
"Just, you know, to see... um."
"OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire."
"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
Oh.
Oh.
"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know."
Whattaya mean?
"Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk."
Mailbox.
Uh-huh.
You guuuyys.
Thinkin' about it.
"Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!"
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
I see.
"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat."
"Hang in there, it's gonna happen."
Because she's your lobster.
"Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out."
So. You two are totally into each other.
"OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?"
"I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh."
"OK, who is the boss of you?!!"
No.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat."
"Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK."
"Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video."
Yes.
"The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video."
Monica.
Chandler.
"Oh yeah, it'll be fun."
Paul.
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
"Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist."
"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend."
"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward."
"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."
"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay."
"Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more."
"Um, not even a little bit."
Oh.
"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
Two?
"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
"No it's not, sorry."
"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
Oh.
"Yeah, no, I understand."
Yeah. Sorry.
What?
"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted."
"No, but he's always late."
"Yeah, yeah. You can do it to."
"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that...."
Feburary 16th.
"Wow, that's close. When's yours?"
"That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?"
So is it like art?
"Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache."
"G'night, bro."
"Here. Y'know, just in case."
I don't have time for this.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
"No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?"
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
You don't play the oboe!
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
I'm sorry.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
I am soo dead.
"I know, you must've won like a contest or something!"
"When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!"
"So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?"
"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?"
"You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!"
"Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me."
"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'"
"Okay, listen Robert..."
"I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say."
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
You think you know me so well.
"Oh, yeah!"
"Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay"
Oh.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
"Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way."
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other."
That would be great. Thank you.
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
"Yeah, what town are we near?"
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
"Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?"
"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
Huh.
"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."
"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
It isn't?
"Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!"
"Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just..."
"What?! Monica, I'm scared!!"
"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field."
Yeah.
Jason is not a sissy!
"Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
I'm sorry.
Hey!
"I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!"
Oh.
Y'know what that means?
"Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!"
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
"Oh, they love your casserole."
No!
Really?!
What?
"Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!"
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
It's okay. How's the soup?
"Yeah, all right."
Bye!
I wa-I wa-I wa...
Monica!
"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
And this?
You make it so funny.
"Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!"
"I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
"Hm-mm, corn beef."
Okay.
Six months.
Not if I get there first.
"Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
"I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!"
Hey! What are you doing here?
I haven't really had any yet.
So you're not homesick yet?
"Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?"
Oh! You have a window!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
OK.
Sorry. How about over here?
"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?"
What about this?
There you go!
"Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie."
"Yeah! Okay, here you go."
"Oh my God, are you guys okay?"
What?
"Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
"Ooh, I have to tell you something."
No.
"Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?"
No.
I don't know!
"Yeah, come to papa."
What?
"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
There's sooo much you don't know.
"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
Sure.
I can hop.
Hi.
"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!"
"Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?"
Oh don't do that.
Oh no no.
"Oh, but I can't do that-"
"It's your thing, and-"
"Okay, um, stay."
Stay.
What makes it pilgrim?
"I, I, I'm hideous."
"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox."
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
I got it.
What?
"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him."
"'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'"
"No, just a barrel."
Really?! Really?!
"Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!"
"Look, look!"
"Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this."
"Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?"
"And, and!"
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!"
"Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies."
Hi!
My Saturn dealership.
Yeah!
"No, you have to let me in right now!!"
I got it! Mine!
Thank you!
"Okay! Okay, ready?"
Okay.
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Me too.
Okay.
Yay!
"Yay!! Oh so, you re not, you re not mad at us anymore?"
Didn t you sleep together?
Oh! Oop!
Wait you stole those from these people s wedding?
"Ooh, I have to tell you something."
But I can t tell you.
"Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn t tell, and I swore to like all my gods."
No.
No.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
"Yeah, I would ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
"Okay, this is what I m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill."
"Aw, honey it s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don t see that happening."
"Aww, good.  What?"
"Yeah, it was really hard."
Jason is not a sissy!
What surprise party?
"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
Not after this!
Okay.
I thought you said you read it in high school.
"Remember, a virgin for me please."
"Well, if you think it will help."
You should! How is she?
You do?
"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don t know what the big deal is!"
"Y know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
"Great, let s begin.  How s the pressure?"
"Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it s not weird is it."
"That s right, you just enjoy."
Okay.
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
You cook naked?
"It s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn t called. Not that I even care, y'know."
You think you know me so well.
Yeah.
That s what I said.
So what are they doing?
I m just taking it to be re-wired.
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Really? Are you sure?
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Remembered what?
Left!  Thank you.
Ross!
How do you feel?
"Okay, so I"
"I know, the babies are asleep."
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven t been able to say two words to each other."
Grasp one of the linen strips by its  easy grab tab  and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Was it not pain-free?
"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don t seem to think it s that bad."
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Uh-huh!
Exactly!
"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,"
"All I could think of was y know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
"I m a lady Monica, I don t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself."
I just like him so much that I just feel like I ve had 10 drinks today and I ve only had six.
You sound like a guy.
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
"Oh, I m sorry. I didn t hear you over all the winning."
Oh! You have a window!
You can't have it.
No
Oh yeah.
"Oh I know, I ve been there. I remember toward the end"
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Go for it.
"Now, have you told anyone else?"
You told me.
"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn t been on the toilet."
"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
Hey!
Yeah!
I know. They were mine.
"No, it s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on."
I m wearing his briefs right now.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I m thinking even more than you.
Well  It s a date.
"Come on Joey, don t make me feel badly about this."
That It s not the same thing! This is
She was?
Yeah!
Yeah!
"No-no, let me in!"
Yeah!
"No, you have to let me in right now!!"
Yes!
"Well, it s just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
"No, we re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette."
"I know, they re gonna be"
Not
Totally. I m like 90/10.
"Oh sure, Cilantro Larry."
"How could you say yes, what about our catering business?"
"Well, I ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note."
Oh! Here s Joseph Francis!
So what?! That doesn t give you the right to ditch me!
With who?
"Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!"
"Hey, how are you guys doing?"
Hey!
"See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!"
"Well, umm, my Mom s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom."
"No, no, it s just my tooth."
"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend  Albino Bob ."
Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
All right.
Wait here. Breathe.
It's like a gift.
Hey!
What?
Yeah?
"So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred."
"I just feel so, uhh....."
"Ohh, they re having a"
So you re not homesick yet?
"Ok, I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh! Better?"
"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
Such a pig!
Oh he's like a...
"Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
The end.
Should I not have told you?
"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not."
Yeah.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Thank God.
"Oh, yay!"
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
You gotta go!
"Okay, don t worry. You re ready."
"If she s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
Oh my God!
"I-I wanna be with her,  I like her."
Hey Rach!
"Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?"
Yeah?
Yeah?
"Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, let s skedaddle."
It s Lafite. The  74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It s over!"
Some guy bought it. I m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
The little jail between the doors!
"I know, I m sorry! But y know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring."
Maybe it was the guy.
"No, we can go together! Just don t wait too long though, okay?  Cause I m outta here sometime before Friday."
What? He s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
I m so glad you could make it.
Yeah I know. Isn t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
We ruined everything.

"Ohh, that s too bad!"
"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
Radiator.
"Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?"
But if...

What do you mean?
You mean a backup?
"Yeah, yeah I got that."
Hm-mmm
Yeah!
"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal."
"I need to talk to you, it s pretty urgent. It s about Monica and Chandler."
Nothing..Why?
Oh yeah it is! I m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Hi!
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah!
"Ooh, now you lost me."
No I didn t!
"No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!"
"Well, he s very charming."
"Well, you re just gonna have to try."

"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
"So, what happens to the old guys?"
"Why, do I have a feeling that s not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!"
Yeah?
"Oh my God, they took my idea!"
"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
I'm totally getting it!
Oh that s all right. I m still full from your homemade potato chips.
Okay.
"Okay, I ll be out in a second."
Alex Trebek?

Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
You two will have very hairy children.

"What?! No, you can t, you can t leave me here with them! We re baby-sitting!"
But you-you can t leave me with them! We-we re a team! We re playing a zone! They re gonna triple team me!

Nestley Toulouse.
"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
Yeah?
"He s awfully short and I think he s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he s not that good in bed."
"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy."
Thanks Monica!
"What the smell from Joey s? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
Okay.
"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother."
"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
Wash your hands!!!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I hope it s you.
Wh-why is that the best part?
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums."
"Ha. Ha, ha."
"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
OK.
"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
"Okay, they're just talking..."
"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!"
"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
"No! Joey, you re going to be great!"
"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room."
"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.  Look, he's opening his eyes."
Oh!
"Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
"Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?"
"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is"
"Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring."
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Uh-huh.
"No thanks, I ve already seen one."
Always.
What?!
Your own boat?
"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
Who said you were?
No! I do want to!
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
"Oo, where are the seats?"
Definitely!
But she just came up here!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
"Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her."
What are you doing?
Oh! You got it?!
The next next?
What s the matter?
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me."
"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail."
Now what is Fabutec?
"Oh, it s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl."
God. Do think it really doesn t hurt?  Cause how can they do that?
Joey stuffing 15
Where were you?
"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
Rachel.
Are you moving out?
"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,"
"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
Which proves that I never lie.
So did Heldi show you the place?
I can t believe you re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
Did I use that already today? I m sorry.
So you don t know that s
They're gonna call her Chandler.
"Oh, hello liar."
I could ve been killed I hope you know!
"Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
What?!  What the hell?!
What?! Why?!
"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
Hi Joey.
I
Uh-hmm.
"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he s gay."
Of course I do! And I m gonna give it back to you as soon as they re done with it at the key shining place.
Speech! Speech! Let s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
You re actually going through with this?
"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
"Well,"
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
Really?!
Thanks.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
"Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!"

What?! What do you mean you re going to London?
"I Rachel, you can t go! Ross loves Emily!"
Are you all right?
Oh my God! He did it?
"I just talked him into it, don t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people."
"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so."
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
You didn t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
"Where?  Ooh, come to Momma."
We should do something. Whistle.
"Come on, do it."
Do it!
Do it do it do it!
"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!"
Yeah.
But what?
"Oh, please!"

"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."

"Oh, it s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?"
Oh no! Why?
"Oh my God! I don t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"

"No, but you're questioning my method!"
"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
"I just can t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?"
"Yeah that s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer."
"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it."
"Well, why don t you just get him fired?"
"Oh, you came on to Ross!"
"Oh, it has a name?"
Where?
You won't even taste it?
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
"Ross, where did you get this?!"
"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in."
"So, I m here, ready to play."
"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha."
"That s a dog, every house should have a dog."
"Well, what period is it from?"
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Okay. Oh but don t tell them Monica s pregnant because they frown on that.
Hey!
We re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
I am
I want to keep one.
"Who, Josh?"
"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
"I m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out."
"Okay, okay, but Rachel s gonna be here too, can t I just ask her this stuff?"
"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
"Umm, Gene."
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
"Why, what happened?"
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
"Yeah, she was bald, she s not now."
"I don t know, I hardly ever say that about people."
"Well I m sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
"Well, maybe it won t work out. Maybe Ross won t like her personality."
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
"Hey, you guys. Listen, I m sorry that I was hogging the game before  Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!"

"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I ll kill"
"Ohh,"
Hands.
Thank you.
Hell yeah! I ll marry you!
"Hey lady, your day s over! It s my turn!"
We don t know.
Who? Who is it?
Was that story over?
I m doing okay. I think it s going well. Do you think they re having fun? Am I talking to fast?
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."
"Well not clients, lovers. But let s just y know, try it again. Come back and-and we ll work through it."
Yes.
"Oh, how did it go?"
What did he say?
"Yeah, maybe."
Any luck?
I know what time you said.
That s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won t open.
Fish!
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here"
"We did have fun, didn't we?"
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
"Yay, okay!"
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
"Yeah, I understand."
"Why, nobody good?"
"Oh, really?"
"Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!"
"Did you, did you"

"Yeah that s great! Next to that, Chandler won t look so stupid."
Okay!
"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
You are just like Jack.
"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
Floopy?
"Oh, like that's a word."
Uh-huh.
"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
"Ok, have a good break-up."
"Yeah, it was really hard."
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Wait here. Breathe.
It's like a gift.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Thanks.
"Oh, that sucks!"
What'd I say?
"Where? Ooh, come to Momma."
We should do something. Whistle.
"Come on, do it."
Maybe nobody's tried this.
"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic."
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Hi.
"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
"No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
So what's going on?
With?
"Hey, what's going on?"
"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me."
Really?
Nope.
Doing it on this table.
Yeah?
"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
Ross says hi.
"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
All right. Bye bye.
Whatcha doin'?
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
"No, but you can't."
Petrie.
This is so great.
Maybe there's someone else.
"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Demi Moore.
"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
Oh. Oh!
Oh my God!
"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
Nah. Not really.
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope."
I can't believe you caved.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did."
And we did.
Yay me.
Um-hum.
Hey.
"Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh."
You guuuyys.
"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today."
Stick a fork what?
"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat."
Oh my God.
"Hang in there, it's gonna happen."
"So, do you have any other possibilities?"
What is that sparkly thing?
"Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out."
So. You two are totally into each other.
"OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?"
"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?"
"OK, who is the boss of you?!!"
"Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went."
No.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge."
Why don't you play with your roommate?
"Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date."
"Hey, hey, no, oh oh."
Are you crazy?
"I'm sorry, I didn't know."
"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents."
"All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again."
"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend."
Two?
"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
"No it's not, sorry."
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
Oh.
"Yeah, no, I understand."
Yeah. Sorry.
What?
"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted."
Hey!
"No, but he's always late."
I just asked you.
Huh?
Oh no! Why?
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
I am soo dead.
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
"I know, you must've won like a contest or something!"
"I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it..."
"When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!"
It's Monica's bed. What?
"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now."
"Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!"
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
"Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?"
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
"Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way."
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other."
"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
Was it not pain-free?
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
"Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin."
"Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?"
"Yes, please."
Yes. Not out loud.
"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
Huh.
It isn't?
"Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
Thanks!
"Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just..."
Jason is not a sissy!
Oh?!
"Okay, I didn't hear that."
They're not even touching the lasagna!
"Oh, they love your casserole."
"Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket."
It's okay. How's the soup?
"Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music."
"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
"No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?"
"Yeah, all right."
I wa-I wa-I wa...
"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
And this?
"I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No."
"It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?"
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Pastrami.
"Hm-mm, corn beef."
Okay.
Six months.
Oh!
"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything."
So you're not homesick yet?
Yeah?
"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
Oh! You have a window!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
You cook naked?
"C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun."
"Oh my God, they took my idea!"
Hey!
What?
"Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
"Ooh, I have to tell you something."
Noo!
"Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?"
No.
What?
"So, did you pick one yet?"
"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?"
"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y."
What makes it pilgrim?
What were you thinking?
Bye.
"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him."
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
"Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way."
Really?! Really?!
"Watch, watch."
"And, and!"
Yeah?
The name was my favourite part!
Yeah!
"No, you have to let me in right now!!"
Yeah.
I got it! Mine!
Thank you!
"Okay! Okay, ready?"
Okay.
Me too.
Me too.
Okay.
