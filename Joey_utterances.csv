"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin ?"""
"Hmmm, soup!"
"Oh yeah, no problem."
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Really?
"Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff."
Mia Hamm?
Oh that s amazing.
Oh wow that s a great idea! And
"Y know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don t get all upset."
All right.
A two and a five.
Really?!
A four and a nine.
No. Why?
I m still on the set!
"I know! I m sorry! The guy s drunk, they won t let me go until we get this."
"No! No, I m the minister! Alright, look-look, put  em both on the phone, I ll marry them right now."
"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?"
"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance."
Why?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
You really think so?
Hi.
"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
Cheese makes me thirsty.
Hey!
Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Ma! What're you doing here?
"Yeah, someplace nice."
"Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?"
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Sweepin . Why? Turn you on?
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Where are you going? The vicar won t be home for hours.
"Where do you think,  Zelda?"
Yeah I did!
Hi!
"Thanks for comin  back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and"
"Now, I m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind."
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.

So the Porsche guy took his car back.

"Hey Estelle, listen"
What are you talkin  about? I never left you! You ve always been my agent!
"I don t have a key, they took mine to give to you."
And the nudity is really important to the story.
You re right. Maybe I shouldn t even go on the call back.
"Hey, what s up?"
"But you re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today."
I know! I found it on the street.
Yeah.
I don t know.
Ew.
What?
With Carol?  Oh.
"But,  you ve got one more apology to make, all right, you ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela."

"Yeah, you re great! Okay, let s take it from"
"Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
"Check it out, he s winning!  Pete s winning!"
"Hey, I m with you. He even asked me if I thought you d go out with him."
I said no.
What? I I just figured since you re pregnant you re not gonna be seeing people.
I didn t tell him. I didn t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not."
"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project."
"Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y know? The only problem is, Carl s acting is"
"Yeah, he s the reason I didn t get that big"
"Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
No.
"3, 2,"
Probably kill myself!
"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
In a minute!!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
"No-no, stay right there.  Gettin  closer."
"No it isn t, I ate that."
"Yeah, me too."
No. Really?
"Yes! Yes, I did."
G-sharp.
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
"Your other student, was you!"
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Ohh!
Joey Tribbiani.
How do
Some guy!!
Ben!
Can we see her?
"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
"Y know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn t give you real names either."
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
"Now, don t hold back."
"Since I don t know anyone here, I thought it d be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
It looks like a women's purse.
"See look,"
Maybe you need sex.
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
"Awww, one of my students got an audition. I m so proud."
"""Can t, its not there."""
Woo-hoo!!
Monica? What time is it?
But it's dark out.
Hey!
"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you re"
"Oh, you re switching apartments?"
But Rachel has an apartment.
She is?
"Ah, Gunther, I can t pay for this right now because I m not working, so I ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin  for stuff."
"And to go from that to this, I just  Plus, I d have to wait on all my friends."
What?!
"Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it."
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
"Ohh, I know one thing!"
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work."
"Oh, I didn't go to college."
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
"And what s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?"
"Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one Dude! They re all huge!"
"All right! I ll try! But if I can t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled."
"But um, I don t think it s anything serious."
"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
I can t believe I m going to lose this job!
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Why should I help you?!
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
"Hey Monica, it's Joey!"
What  cha doing?
What about the chick?
Are you sure?
Sure.
Hey.
"Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?"
"Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y know, sexually?"
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything."
"Or not. Uh, Rach, why don t you just move in with me?"
"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no  It s okay, I mean I look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday s thing, but we don t have to do that!"
"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
"Oh, it is."
"Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed."
Cat.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
"I know, it was the best I could get out of them."
"Uh, she s with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray."
Remoray. It s Portuguese. We need that information. I m a doctor.
Damnit woman we re losing precious time! Now do you want this man s blood on your head?
"He s a patient of mine, I ve been treating him for years!"
"816, thank you!"
Hey!
Huh? Uh
"Oh!  Sorry. Uh, I ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?"
What?! Tonight?!
"Wait a second, I could star in it!"
"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep."
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy."
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out."
I didn t look at it. Stupid baby s head was blocking most of  it.
"Look, it s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don t want to hurt her."
Now I can t believe it! What? Rachel s pregnant?  Who s the father?
Ohh  I wonder if that dude.
Yeah.
"About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn t see who it was but"
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!"
"Uh yeah, where-where s the guy who decides who s pictures go up on the wall?"
I m an actor. I m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?"
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?"
Really? To what?
"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man."
It was funny  til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
"Oh yeah?  If I can t, I ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
Hey! What s up?
"Hey-hey, who s your friend?  Hey!!"
Erin! Still here!
What s the matter?
What is it? Hey!
"Rach come on, what?"
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat."
"Do you uh, do you ready for a refill?"
"But if you re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you d be wrong."
"It s uh, right through there."
"Okay, good, good, good,  cause, good,  cause I was kinda having second thoughts too."
It's creamier.
"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
"No. No, I m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I m the guy in the coma!"
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me"
I don t know. Why? Did you hear something?
"Listen uh, not that I m y know insecure about my manhood or anything y know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now."
Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
"Y know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?"
Oh! Maybe it s because I m on television. I m an actor on
"Well, how-how come?"
"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about."
"All right, all right."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk."
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?"
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
Which I'm not.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
"Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out."
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and"
No.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Thanks!
Done!
It's not.
Aww man! I can t believe I locked myself out again!
"So, does that mean the audition is off?"
"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands."
What's up man?
"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?"
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
Probably kill myself!
"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
What?
With Carol? Oh.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
What?
"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
Yep.
Which what?
Oh my god.
"So, you and Angela, huh?"
"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
What?
"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Hi everyone.
What's up man?
Twice?
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
What's wrong?
Oh. What?
That tone will not make me go any faster.
"Me neither, y'know what-"
"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!"
How'd you get to that?
You knew about that?
"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
Yeah
"Why, are you moving out?"
"Night, you guys."
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
"Hey. Morning, dear."
Ma! What're you doing here?
Oww! Big ring!
"Hold on, you-you knew?"
I'm...happy...for you?
"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Out.
"Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?"
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
When's that?
"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
You don't drink.
"Oh, Urse..."
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
"no. No, I, I couldn't do that."
"I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful."
She really said that?
"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
"I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
"All right, all right."
Do we have to know about that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
"Oh, it is."
"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
"Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
Shhhh!
"Uh, does it hurt?"
Who?
"Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head."
Hey Phoebs.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
And?
"All right Phoebs, way to go."
"Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
Oh my God.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
"Hey, here she comes."
Hey.
"Rach, these are for you."
Uh-huh.
"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
She's comin'.
No one.
"Good, otherwise my watch would fall off."
Hey I-
This is amazing.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Oooh.
Ma?
"Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off."
Are you naked in there?
"Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?"
"Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes."
"Well, let me see."
"Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing."
"Can't help you, I'm not wearing any."
"Heh, what d'ya say?"
"Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking."
Alright open your eyes.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
"Ohh yeah, that's the stuff."
"Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax."
Hi.
She laughed at you?
What?
"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man."
Well that's how I feel.
Well then maybe I will.
"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
"Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee."
Hey!
Wow.
"Oh, now it's a spare room?"
Eddie.
Huh.
"Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man."
"Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?"
"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?"
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
"All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks."
Hey no problem.
A little foos?
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
"Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will."
"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared."
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
"Come on, I need your help here."
"You see this, this is a friend."
"All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider."
"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
What is this? Fruit?
"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person."
"You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
"Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you."
Pheebs! There you are!
"Okay, shoot."
I didn't get it?
Oh.
"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
"You do, thanks."
Wait a minute.
"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent."
Hey!
"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?"
"Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
"Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it."
"That's a uh, that's a tough combination."
"Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?"
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
"Well, they go into the chipper."
"Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper."
"Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?"
What?
Who?
Okay.
"Beth is really, really sick."
"Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do."
"Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
Yeah. You okay?
"Uh, 10:30."
4:30.
"Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
She was kidding about that right?
"God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
"Dude, I don't know."
Yeah.
"Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing."
"Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?"
It'll be great for next weekend.
"Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh."
"Well, have-have you told him how you feel?"
Good. Hey.
"Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni."
"So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?"
"Oh, forget about it. She rocks!"
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
Yeah.
"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch."
"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'"
Better?
"Ah, Kate?"
"You ah, you forgot your shoes."
"Hey, listen you ah...."
"Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking."
"Kate, do you even like me?"
Where's Kate?
"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
"So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on."
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Huh?!
He cut off his ear.
"Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'."
"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
"You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!"
"Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck."
"What, what is it?"
"Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?"
"Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time."
No I didn't.
Hey!
"Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?"
"Okay, I see what's going on here."
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Hello.
Stop callin'!!
Hey!
No! I'm putting that in my room.
"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?"
Five years.
"No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open."
What?
Yeah!
"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
Guggly worm.
"Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?"
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah?
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
"Oooh, what you got there?"
"Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?"
"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?"
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Hey!
The ring is gone!
Come on! Do something!
"Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey."
"It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map."
I got it! Here we go.
Really? To what?
"Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!"
Hey.
Have you seen Monica?
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
Yeah?
"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
"Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday."
Hey.
"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television."
I've never slept with someone for a part.
"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her."
No problem. Hey Chandler
Ok.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
"Come on, quite yankin' me."
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Wheel!
"I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
"Look, what do you want me to say?"
"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
"No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
Hey!!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Hey.
You got it! Oh-oh!
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Don't answer that.
Awful! Horrible!
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Which goes where?
"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
I figure my character has kids.
"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie."
What a phony.
"Joseph's good, isn't he?"
"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
Really?
"Hey-hey, Ross?"
"Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
"Hey, Kate!"
"Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week..."

"Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!"
"Uh, Pheebs, about your mom..."
"Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin."
"Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
"No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?"
Ameri-ccan.
You liked it? You really liked it?
Which part exactly?
"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics."
"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?"
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I ll have my health insurance back in no time.

"No way!  Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!"
"Uhh, the ball thing."
"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!"
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
I gotta go check something over here.
Wow! This looks great!
"Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin  to that place."
All right! I ll have a sandwich!

"What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!"
Okay.

"Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!"
Hello.

"All right, I guess this will be fine."
"Nothing, why?"
"Huh, Rach I got to say it s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude."
Really?  Cause I could kinda use the money.
"Yeah, okay."
Whoa
That's the rule.
How'd you get to that?
You knew about that?
"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
Yeah
Why not?
"Why, are you moving out?"
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"

"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
"No-no-no, I think I m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She s pretty cool."
"No-no, Kathy."
"No. No, Kathy."
"You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
"Whoa, ah!! We re you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
"Oh right, right."

Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture I didn't have my camera!
"It s no big deal. Hey, y know, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
"Well, I like it. Here you go."
"Oh, I embarrass you?"
No there won t! I promise I will finish that turkey!

Don t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
"Ooh, I ll play! I ll play!"
Hey.
The ring is gone!
"Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place."
"What-what is it, what is it?"
"Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
"I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!"
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
"Listen, you know how uh, when you re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?"
"Well, when Jake did it I saw that he was wearing women s underwear!"
"Oh.  No! No wait, that s weird!"
That s weird!
"Yeah, I wouldn t know about that."
"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys."
Hey! I
"Yeah uh look Rach, there s something I gotta tell ya."
Dear Lord.
"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that "
"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!"
"Well, she graduated from high school!"
Fine!
Fine!
I bet  ya ya I could fit in there.
"Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles."

"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?"
Hello.
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
"Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize."
"No! No, fear of the number 13."
"All right Chandler, you re up."
"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
"Choose, you jackass!"
"Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don t you wanna stay here and talk about it?"
"Well, what did you have?"
"Uh,  wow, 700."

What?
Really?
Where you going?
Sperm or regular?
"So you're really doing this, huh?"
Sounds nice.
"No kiddin', hmm."
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!
"When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing."
"Nothing. It s just old and dingy, that s all."
"Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.  Yeah."
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Eh! There you go.
How s that going?
"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
"Kinda, but I ve just been having way too much fun."
"No, I don t think so."
Okay! When?!
Uh-huh!
I want to do it again.
"No, that s"
"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven t really paid the bill"
"Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
"Looks good, uh?"
"Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!"
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
"Aww, you guys are so cute!"
"All right, I'll see you in the morning."
What do you like better action or comedy?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something."
"Oh, just had a baby."
"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!"
"Yeah me too, all night."
"Yeah, but I don t wanna die!"
"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It s a one day job, max."
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Really?
"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
Surprise
"Hey, the fight s starting!"
Hey!
"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
Hey! Any good mail?
"Ooh, it s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I m kinda ."
Hmm that s weird. I don t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Let me see that!
"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I m gonna go see my agent."
"Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
"Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
Sure.
All right.
"Oh, that s, that s ah, one of the old ones, he s just taking it to the back."
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
"Well, they go into the chipper."
For a walk.
"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts."
"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!"
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
How do you think she's doing?
What?
The balloon?
"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
Oh what then? Kick me?
Instead of...?
What s my little chef got for me tonight?
"Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!"
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
What?
"Come on, they're close."
"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
Ow!
"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
IN LONDON!!!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's"
"Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns."
You got a better idea?
Heads.
Yes! Whew!
"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
Yeah.
Mine!

"Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might ve happened to a huge chunk of it."
Bwah-hah-hah!
What message?
What?! It s 6 o clock!
"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"
"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that s nice!"
"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those"
"Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
Yeah well we should order some food then.
That sounds fair.
"All right, well I guess I ll just have to do what I do on dates."
"Yeah. Uh,  a slice  six dollars?"
"Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don t!"
"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
"That s a uh, that s a tough combination."
Like you wouldn t believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Oh-oh! So that s the way it s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y know!
I don t know.
Y know what Ross? I m not gonna let you get away with this!
Well we ll see!
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
"No, I m picking you up for our date. These are for you."
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
"Ah  Hey, so this roommate of yours is he good looking?"
"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
He forgot to leave his grip size!
So are you gonna tell him?
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Her answer machine?
"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?
"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
"Mm, yum!"
"No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
Phonetically?
"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ."
Come on! you...
What?
"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
Oh my god.
"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down."
"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
Oh really? That d be great! You guys can be the contestants!
All right! Let s play Bamboozled!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
"No, the quiet down thing!"
"Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my"
"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game."
"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!"
"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!"
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here."
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!
"Y know, I m beginning to see what Jake was talking about."
"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go"
You could?
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Can I ask you something?
"Felicity and I, we re watching"
"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y know, you think I ll ever get there?"
Thanks man.
"I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?"
"Ooh, great! Thanks!"
"You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I ll tell ya"
"Hey, y know what?"
Why don t I take you out?
I ll be fun.
Hey!
"Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good"
"Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?"
"Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
"Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
"Well, I don t know!!"
"Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I d better go."
"Yeah. All right, I ll talk to you later."
No! Never! Never!  Bye.
You opened them all?
Oh hey! You got my parent s gift!
"Well, I don t know. I think it does something to salami."
"I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you."
"Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you re not gonna be alone in this."
You serious?
"Okay, get ready to owe me!"
"Okay, here we go. Ready?"
"I m sorry, do I know you?"
"Nothing, I m just practicing blowing you off because I m gonna be a big movie star!"
"Okay, shoot."
I didn't get it?
"Okay, what else?"
Oh.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
"Hey, what time is it?"
"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?"
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"
Hey Ross. It s Joey. There s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you d know something about it.
"Oh don t listen to him, he s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don t think he s gonna get it."
"Oh well, hey, Joey s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he ll be there."
Hey Pheebs!
"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what"
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
That would be Casey. We re going out tonight.
"No, things are fine with Kathy. I m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
What is the big deal? It s not like we re exclusive.
You got all that from the back of her head?
I don t know Rach.
"Dude, if you go back out there, you re gonna be Dead Ross!"
I thought you already have a job.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
What is it?
You cooked him?
"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
I d really prefer a mountain bike.
"No, no, you can t, you can t, okay, you can t, you can t buy her pearls, you just can t, you can t, you can t."
"Oh God. Uh, okay, here s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is..."
"Okay. I went down to the  Mattress King  showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
They were in his office.
"Come here, check this out!"
"No! No-no. Look, there s a bug stuck in tar right here."
"Y know, there s"
Right-right up here.
"I don t know!   Yeah, I do."
What?! All right Hey! Don t look at me! You re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
What the hell!
"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?"
"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
"Nah, you re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
Great! Go get him.
He s not really my type.
"Hey man, you feeling any better?"
"Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?"
Die Hard 2
And?
"I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba..."
Kate Miller it is.
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Really?
"Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff."
"All right, let's go Pheebs."
Mia Hamm?
Oh that s amazing.
A two and a five.
Really?!
A four and a nine.
No. Why?
I m still on the set!
"I know! I m sorry! The guy s drunk, they won t let me go until we get this."
"No! No, I m the minister! Alright, look-look, put  em both on the phone, I ll marry them right now."
"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?"
"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
No.
You really think so?
"Thanks, Chandler."
Hey!
Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
Gotcha.
"Oh, you bet I am!"
Yeah.
"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!"
Sweepin . Why? Turn you on?
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Where are you going? The vicar won t be home for hours.
"Where do you think,  Zelda?"
Yeah I did!
"Okay, look I m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn t have, but you got porn!"
Well you re whippin  so slow! Can t you do it any faster?
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
"Aww, man, now we won t be bank buddies!"
"Y know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something."
"I don t have a key, they took mine to give to you."
You re right. Maybe I shouldn t even go on the call back.
"But you re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today."
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
I know! I found it on the street.
Yeah.
I don t know.
Ew.
What?
All right.
"Cookie, now you can punch him!"
"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories."
No! I won t leave you!
No you re not! Not to me!
What?
"Yeah, you re great! Okay, let s take it from"
"Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
Y know what? I think that s enough for now. Yeah. I don t want to be over rehearsed.
"Hey, I m with you. He even asked me if I thought you d go out with him."
I said no.
What? I I just figured since you re pregnant you re not gonna be seeing people.
I didn t tell him. I didn t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
"Rach look, I really don t think that s such a great"
What s going on?
Probably kill myself!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
"Yeah, me too."
No. Really?
"Yes! Yes, I did."
G-sharp.
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
"Your other student, was you!"
Hey!
What did you say to him?
How do
Some guy!!
"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
Can we see her?
"Y know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn t give you real names either."
You really think so?
"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
It looks like a women's purse.
"See look,"
Maybe you need sex.
"Oh yeah, who s playing?"
Yeah but we won t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Monica? What time is it?
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you re"
"Oh, you re switching apartments?"
But Rachel has an apartment.
She is?
I guess I didn t really think about it.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
"Ohh, I know one thing!"
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
I totally don t know what you re talking about.
Well he made Rachel cry!
I like it.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!"
What about the chick?
Are you sure?
Sure.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Hey.
"Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?"
'Tonight' tonight?
"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything."
That's right baby.
"Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed."
Cat.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
And what is his name?
What do you got there?
Huh? Uh
"Oh!  Sorry. Uh, I ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?"
What?! Tonight?!
"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now."
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy."
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out."
I didn t look at it. Stupid baby s head was blocking most of  it.
"Look, it s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don t want to hurt her."
Now I can t believe it! What? Rachel s pregnant?  Who s the father?
"About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn t see who it was but"
The guy left this.
"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!"
"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?"
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
-Peaches?
Really? To what?
"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
What is it? Hey!
"Rach come on, what?"
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
You said number two.
"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat."
"Do you uh, do you ready for a refill?"
"It s uh, right through there."
Hey!
"Okay, good, good, good,  cause, good,  cause I was kinda having second thoughts too."
"That s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man."
It's creamier.
"All right, all right."
"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?"
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and"
No.
Yes!
Thanks!
Done!
It's not.
Hey! He beat ya.
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
What's up man?
"Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen."
"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."""
"Oh, ""you do, do you""?"
Probably kill myself!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
-Peaches?
What?
"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
What?
"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
Yep.
Which what?
Oh my god.
What?
"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
Ow!
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
What's up man?
You guys okay?
We did?
That tone will not make me go any faster.
How'd you get to that?
You knew about that?
"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
Yeah
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
So what's it gonna be?
"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
"Hey. Morning, dear."
What's the matter with you?!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
You're in!
Out.
Yes.
He should take the sack?
When's that?
"Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
Urse...
You don't drink.
"Oh, Urse..."
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
"no. No, I, I couldn't do that."
Pheebs?
"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
What?
"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
She really said that?
'Tonight' tonight?
"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
Hey! He beat ya.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
"Marcel, I'm hungry."
What about Andre?
"All right, all right."
Do we have to know about that?
"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
Shhhh!
She's still asleep.
"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
"No, seriously."
What?
Hey Phoebs.
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
And?
"All right Phoebs, way to go."
"Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this."
Hey.
How far'd ya get?
Uh-huh.
"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
Ma?
"Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off."
Are you naked in there?
"Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?"
"Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes."
"Well, let me see."
Chandler's wearing panties.
"Can't help you, I'm not wearing any."
"Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong."
"Heh, what d'ya say?"
Hey.
Alright open your eyes.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
"Ohh yeah, that's the stuff."
Hi.
She laughed at you?
What?
Well that's how I feel.
Well then maybe I will.
"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
"So, I guess this is it."
"Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care."
Yeah.
Hey!
"Oh, now it's a spare room?"
"Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys."
"Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?"
Huh.
"No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me."
So how you two gettin' along?
"Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man."
"Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?"
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Hello.
A little foos?
What happened to the foosball?
Freaky.
"Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo."
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
"You see this, this is a friend."
"Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!"
"Hey, Ross, want some cider?"
Did I get it?
"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you."
Pheebs! There you are!
They actually said that?
I didn't get it?
"Okay, what else?"
"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
"You do, thanks."
Wait a minute.
"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent."
Hey!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
"Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
"Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's."
"Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah."
"Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it."
Eh! There you go.
Why don't we just go on two.
"Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!"
"That's a uh, that's a tough combination."
"Well, I-I might've said supergay."
What? Me having a job?
Merry Christmas!!
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Hey.
Okay.
"Beth is really, really sick."
"Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do."
Where have you been?
"Uh, 10:30."
4:30.
"Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
She was kidding about that right?
"God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
"Dude, I don't know."
Yeah.
"Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing."
"Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?"
"Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?"
It'll be great for next weekend.
"It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat."
What's going on?
"Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh."
What was it?
"No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
"So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on."
Huh?!
"Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!"
"Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet."
Hey!
"Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?"
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
"Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Hey!
"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?"
Five years.
"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I..."
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
"All right, I'll see you guys."
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Guggly worm.
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
"Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?"
"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?"
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
"Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?"
"Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!"
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
The ring is gone!
"Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey."
"It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map."
I got it! Here we go.
"Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!"
Have you seen Monica?
What?
Thank you.
Mmmm. Good.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
You cuddled.
"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
Yeah?
..Naughty!
"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
"Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
Hey.
"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television."
Ok.
"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
"Come on, quite yankin' me."
Wheel!
"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
"Look, what do you want me to say?"
"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
Done with the bookcase!
You got screwed.
"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
I figure my character has kids.
"Joseph's good, isn't he?"
"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
"Hey-hey, Ross?"
I've got a science question.
They were in his office.
"Hey uh, what's a matter?"
"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
Hey.
Hey.
"No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate."
"Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making..."
"How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide."
"Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!"
"All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them."
"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!"
