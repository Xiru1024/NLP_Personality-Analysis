Me too!
I know.
"Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!"
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
"Now, I'm just letting you know that this is"
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
"No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times."
"Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily."
"No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn t a chair."
"I m just gonna throw it out, it s probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
"All right, cut, let s pick again, pick again."
"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.

They're male nurses.
"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?"
"Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
What?
"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some"
"Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me."
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
"Monica, betting the apartment, I don t know about this."
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?

Hey!
"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight."
You are having a party tonight??
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?
You do that every year??
"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??"
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
Who's this from?
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.

This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  You re Bonnie?
"Oh no, I m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you."
"Yes, I do."
"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
"Oh-oh, you lie."
"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
"You know what honey, you go ahead, we ll call her an alternate."
Okay.
Pick one.
You re welcome.
"Y know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness."

"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
"Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?"
"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?"
"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
You re gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Okay. Let s use this brush.

"Even if people are on it!"""
"Hi! Okay, don t be mad at me, but I couldn t resist."
"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
"I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
"All right, Julie."
"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
"All right, I'm outta here!"

"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!"
We re gonna find love!
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
"Well y know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they re 40, they marry each other."
Exactly!
You do?
Who?
Are you serious?!
"Wh  So  If neither of you are married by the time you re 40, you re gonna marry Joey."

Y'know Marcel?
Hi Pheebs!

"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy s cell phone?"
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
You stole the phone!
"No? So you re saying that if I called it, it wouldn t ring?"
"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?"
I ll be out in a second.
"Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00."
Yeah.
"Oh please, they're having sex."
"Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?"
"Ohh! And I m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!"
"Now, he doesn t get in until 10, so he s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,"
Let s roll!
"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan."
"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
They had to have that specially made?!
"Oh, you go out with him."
"Ross, get over it! It s not like she hates you."
"Ross, she s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind."
And Joey?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Thank you!
Sit!
They re not true?
Oh.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
Why aren t you home yet?!
"Oh yes, it s me! Sorry!"
"Uh, I m just, I m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?"
"Oh, he brought her back to his apartment."
"Ugh, she"
"Oh my God, look-look he s taking off her clothes!"
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
"Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn t tell him that, though? Right?"
It depends on who asked.
"Oh, Mon, sure."
Yes.  You re not asking are you?
"You are not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?"
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.

"Look at that guy by the window, wow!"
"Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
Yeah.
I know.
Why not? I don t want to do this alone! And he s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.

"God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
"Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress."

Oh my God.
"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
"Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.

"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
"I mean, that s got to come in handy"
Hi Pheebs!

"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
"Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"

Hi.
Uhh  I think I just got engaged.
And you really think this is a good idea?
I just don t know! It just doesn t feel right.
I guess so.
"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it s remotely related to the field they re interested in."
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
"It s not funny, this is actually my job."
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Yes?!
We can't. We're not pharmacists!

Oh my God! I m gonna have to find another minister.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.

She could be out of town. Maybe she ll be gone for months.
No that could kill her.
"No, so we re protecting her."
But we should move quick.
"No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!"
"I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down."

"Joey,  where did you learn that word?"
You found my book?!
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!"
"No, I did, but tell me again, because it s so romantic."
"Well y know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they d put salt on their cereal."
Yeah? You like that one?
"And then when they do it, they re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face."

Good day for married people huh?
"Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
You said she was bald.

"Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes."

Oh my God.
": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!"
What are you doing?
"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
"Oh, I think I saw some in here."
"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
"No.  And then I called him, and he wasn t there."
Hello.
You wanna go in the bedroom? It s a little more comfortable.
"Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?"
"No seriously, y know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?"
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don t get.
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Yes I did! And I put a little
"Y know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk."
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
"No! Come on its late, we re not gonna go down to the office."
"Chandler, there s a guy right over there."
Yeah.
"Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
"Well, I just called Joshua"
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married I m just going through a hard time."
"Well uh, his answering machine was"
"Y know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don t think I m handling it all that well."
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just"
Ohh!
Really?!
I mean you definitely should do that.
Yeah!
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long."

"Oh please, he ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs."
"I m just saying that y know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and he s gonna have his own life. Right?"
Ohhh!
I don t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing."
What am I making him by the way?
"Y know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
"Monica, number one, I don t think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!"
Can t I just look at the handles on them?
I m gonna give you my weeks notice.
"Ohh, I mean it s just so realistic!"
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
"Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!"
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal."
"Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
We did!
"Oh, I would love to!"
"Good, good, good, good, good."
What s your favourite thing about summertime?

"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y know what, the"
Hey!
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan."
"Oh, that sounds great."
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!
"Uh, yeah, if you want too."
"And um, what-what is that Ross?"
What?! Are you crazy?
"Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!"
No! They are mine!
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they re probably not even listening!"
Barry?
"Oh, not much. I-I got a job."
Why are- why are you so tanned?
"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!"
"Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!"
Okay..
Wow.
What?
"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
Okay.
What's that?
"Oh, God, ask them what they want."
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
"Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?"
"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
"But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh please, they're having sex."
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
"Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
What uh-oh?
"Ross, what's the matter?"
"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
Yes! Did you see that?
"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
Hmmm... this is so nice.
OK.
"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
And Joey....
And Ross.
He doesn't speak much English.
Look at that!
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
"That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
"Hi, I'm Rachel."
"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib."
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
I thought it was Chandler!
This is just occurring to you?
"Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?"
"No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!"
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
"I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach."
"..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
"Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said ""yes."""
"Okay no, you do it."
What?
Oh.
Hi!
"Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
"Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!"
"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
"Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women."
"Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit."
That'd be good.
Barry?!
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
Where the hell've you been?
Are you drunk?!
"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
"Well, you were pretty damn good."
"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
Could tonight be the Night?
"So, did you shave your legs?"
"Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
"You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!"
What?
What?
"Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!"
"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important."
Huh?
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
No!
"No, I'm just...."
Wha...
Who is it?
What?
"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything."
Did you talk to him?
Here's your lemonade.
"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
"Wait, are you leaving?"
"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
"Oh, this is so cute."
"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this."
"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
What?
"Monica, let it go."
"Hi, hi can I help you?"
"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see."
"Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything."
"OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?"
But what about Phoebe?
How long do cats live?
"Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?"
That's just great.
"Oh, right, clink."
"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend."
I mean he just started going out with her.
"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you."
"Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?"
"Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?"
Hi.
"Oh, that's um, interesting."
"Alright, I got it Ross."
What?
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
What?
"Hey, Mom? Having fun?"
Does anybody need anything?
No.
No.
"OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater."
"OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play."
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
"Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert."
"Oh, God."
"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . ."
No.
"Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours."
You didn't get it?
Why didn't you get it?
"Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood."
NO!
"Ohh, what is in that?"
"No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross."
Are you kidding me?
For what?
Oh no.
"Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry."
"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
"Okay, I'll see you after the thing."
What.
Oh dear God.
"Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy."
"Oh my God, what happened?"
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
"Honey, you got a little thing on your..."
Yeah.
"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof."
"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
"Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
Hey Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?
What?
"Oh, sorry."
Hi Daddy!
Um. yeah.
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here."
What?
"Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!"
"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan."
Op.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Yeah.
Yeah. Hi Mark!
"Oh, I did!"
Hey.
All right.
What?
Awwww.
"Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind."
"Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark."
"Because, he's my friend."
"Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?"
"I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me."
Really!?
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
"Oh, that is so..."
Hello.
"Oh, hi."
"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Well neither do I!
Oh my God.
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
Hello!
Oh.
"No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!"
"Yeah. Well, umm....."
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Hello.
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Nobody.
Hey.
"Well, we never actually got to dinner."
"No, we kinda broke up instead."
"God, Monica it's on the ceiling."
"Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
"Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit."
"Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since."
I know.
"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no."
"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
"Oh, that must be it."
"Ohhhh, sorry I missed that."
Ohh!
"I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'"
"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!"
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts."
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Yeah!!
It's me! Good morning!
"Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!"
"Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full."
"Well, I thought you liked doing it."
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
Oh. Stop it!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
I think he's stealing from me.
Because he's stealing from me!
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Thank you.
"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
Heard what?
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Hi!
"Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-"
Sure.
Okay.
Basketball!
"Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you."
"Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off."
Hey!
Oh my God! Look at this!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
And did you?!
"Oh, it's just an anti-theft device."
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Hi! Phoebe.
No we...
"...hormones, yeah."
You all know? Does Ross know?
Pheebs?
"Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?"
"Ohh, good."
Coffee.
Cappuccino.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Yeah?
"But, but?"
Who was that?
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
Wow... Wow!
"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
Get down?
"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss.."
"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
Yeah.
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
Come on you gotta have one!
"Ross, you know what..."
"...if you tell me, I might do it."
"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
Pretty much.
"Yeah, come here!"
Oww!
Oww!
"I'm fine, I'm fine."
Yes I am!
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Whoa-ho.
I don't know.
"So umm, does it?"
Are you sure?
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
"Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?"
"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!"
Really?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Really?
Okay.
Ohhh!!!!
"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
"Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!"
"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks."
"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
What did you just say?
"Ohh, ohh."
Really?
"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
Noo.
"Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know."
Ross kissed me.
It was unbelievable!
"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it."
Oh my god.
"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape."
No.
That's what I said.
"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking."
Oh yeah.
"Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor."
"Bye, Chandler."
"Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore."
"No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!"
Uh-huh.
Ooohhhh!!
"Oh, I...."
Well...
Call her! Call her now!
"Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!"
That's fine!
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
"Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep."
"Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?"
"Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?"
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
"Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school."
They had to have that specially made?!
"Yes, I do."
Relaxi-Taxi!
You know? Forget it!
"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know"
What are you doing here?
Oh.
Hi.
"Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn t shut up."
Me too!
I know.
"Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!"
"Oh my God! Listen to you talkin  about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please don t get married before I do."
Really!?
"Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?"
"""Ooo,"" what?"
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
"No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times."
"Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily."
"No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
Yeah.
"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn t a chair."
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!
"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
You had no
"But I told you, I didn t have the time!"
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Uh-huh.
Really?
I would love to live with you Ross.. that s-that s great! Thank you!
"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!"
It was an amazing night.
Oh but look! That s gonna leave a stain!
Really?
I ve never lived like this before.
"Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so"
"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
I m not gonna marry Chandler!
"So Pheebs, what is the book about?"
Does it still hurt?
Good for you Pheebs!
They're male nurses.
What?
"Joey, how do you make"
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
"Well, that shouldn t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men."
"Monica, you don t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!"
I m sorry. I m so sorry.
"Yeah, sure. Umm here."
"Yeah, I don t think so Joe."
"Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?"
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I ll pay.
I m not asking you to go on a
Yeah?
"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
What?!
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
What-wh-what so we ll just stay married forever?!
You are asking me to be your wife!
Ross!
"What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?"
"Oh God  Oh, he s in there right now?"
"Uh, let s rip!"
Oh Phoebe!
"Hi, sweetie!"
I?ve got some bad news.
"I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here."
"Nooo, he?s leaving for a better job."
I knew.
I did.
"Yeah, maybe..."
What?! What else did he say?
"Ross, no! There is"
"Ross, I am a human doodle!!"
"Oh wait, don t you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?"
OK.
Ohhh!!!!
"Oh, look at the little cat!"
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Oh my god.
"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!"
"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!"
Hey!
"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight."
You are having a party tonight??
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?
You do that every year??
"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??"
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
What did you just say?
"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
"Oh-oh, you lie."
"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
"You know what honey, you go ahead, we ll call her an alternate."
Pick one.
You re welcome.
Joey!  We should just switch.
It s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
"Ross you re not listening to me, I don t have time to stop."
I don t have ten minutes!!
"Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don t!"
"Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I ll talk to you later."
"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
"Yeah, why?"
"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?"
 Cos I was gonna say there s no way you could ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
That's not what we're gonna do!
"What did, what did he say?"
Yeah.
You. Like you haven t done enough.
"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have"
"Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone."
"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!"
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone"
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.

"I mean I m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what s 2%? That s nothing."
"Umm, I think he s still out. What s wrong?"
"""Pheebs, can t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy.""  Big Daddy?"
"Yeah, I m just mad!"
"Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night."
"Okay, stop what you re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers....."
"Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!"
We won. We won!

"Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
"Oh, God..."
"Well, Joshua s coming in tomorrow and since I don t have the guts to ask him out, I m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket."
"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
"Ross, it's too hard."
"Ross, you're like my best friend."
"Pheebs, that s great!"
"But y know umm, Rachel doesn t rhyme with draddle."

Oh my God.
You didn t break up with that fireman?
Wow!
"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
Really?! How come we didn t cross paths?
"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!"
"All right, I'm outta here!"
"So just bring it back downstairs, what s the problem?"
"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?"
Yeah and we ll drop it off downstairs so that we re not tempted.

Oh. Oh wait no.

"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you ll have to think of something else."
"Well y know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they re 40, they marry each other."
Exactly!

Are you serious?!
"Wh  So  If neither of you are married by the time you re 40, you re gonna marry Joey."
You can keep those pants by the way.

Well did you know he was gonna ask me?
And you really think this is a good idea?
I just don t know! It just doesn t feel right.
Really?! Even Ross?
I guess so.
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it s remotely related to the field they re interested in."
"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."
We can't. We're not pharmacists!

"Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
"Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it."

"That proposal, at the planetarium"
"Well, that would ve been very hard to say no too."

"Why, does she have a bad personality?"
"Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?"
Hmm.
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
"Well honey, what about you?"
"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?"
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you re thinking about Naked Wednesday s."
"Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant."
I came with Paul!
"All right, so we weren t"
"Oh, everything went great."
Oh my God.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Here?! Now?!
Hey!
Rachel.
"Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it s not!"
"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they re not moving in."
"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room."
"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I m also really psyched  cause I don t have to move in here!"
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you ve got a girlfriend?
Oh my God.
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break."
": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!"
What are you doing?
"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom."
"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
"Oh, I think I saw some in here."
"I don t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it ll die."
"Well, honey that was pretty obvious."
"Hi! Oh, I m so glad you called."
"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
"Chandler, there s a guy right over there."
"Chandler, don t worry! This doesn t make you any less of a guy!"
What?
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married I m just going through a hard time."
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Hey!
"Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!"
What?
You're not an artist.
Nothing.
Really it s nothing. I m just
I ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
"Oh please, he ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs."
"I m just saying that y know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and he s gonna have his own life. Right?"
I don t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Really?!
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I m just glad we didn t do anything stupid."
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
"Oh, I probably shouldn t so I will!  Oh! Wow! It s like it s raining!"
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
"Okay.  God y know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani s apartment"
I don t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal."
"Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
We did!
"Oh, I would love to!"
"Good, good, good, good, good."
What-what are-what are these?
"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
"Uh, yeah, if you want too."
"Yeah, sure?"
"And um, what-what is that Ross?"
What?! Are you crazy?
"Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!"
"Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!"
No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!!
Of course they re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
"Well, I-I could live without it."
"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
What's that?
"Oh, God, ask them what they want."
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
...Jack from downstairs?
"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
"But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
Yeah.
"Oh please, they're having sex."
"So, whaddya think George is like?"
How long?
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
He is so cute!
"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
What uh-oh?
"Ross, what's the matter?"
Does it still hurt?
Who is being loud?
OK.
Ohhh!!!!
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
And Joey....
And Ross.
"Oh... Italy, I think."
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
"Do what, do what?"
Or?
This is just occurring to you?
"Oh, howd she take it?"
"No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!"
"Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said ""yes."""
Was that the cake?
I hope it's okay.
"Okay no, you do it."
What?
"Okay, let me just change."
Oh.
Hi!
"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
"Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
Barry who I almost.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
Nooo...
Where the hell've you been?
Are you drunk?!
Monica? Monica!
"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
What?
"Well, you were pretty damn good."
Could tonight be the Night?
"So, did you shave your legs?"
What?
What?
Huh?
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
No!
What?
"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything."
"Yeah, sure."
Did you talk to him?
"Then, no."
"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
"Wait, are you leaving?"
"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?"
"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room."
What?
"Monica, let it go."
Do you?
"So, how was the party?"
"Oh, that's um, interesting."
"Alright, I got it Ross."
What?
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
What?
"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas."
Did you just break the radiator?
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
No.
No.
"OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater."
"OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play."
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
"OK, well, bye-bye again."
"What, what incident?"
"Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert."
Oh.
"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
What?
Well I. . .
No.
You didn't get it?
Why didn't you get it?
NO!
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
"Ok, here, I know what we can do."
Oh no.
"Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry."
"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July."
Oh dear God.
She you in the parking lot.
"""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."""
"Yeah, I just have to get dressed."
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Monica's making jam.
"Honey, you got a little thing on your..."
Hello.
"Yeah, you do."
"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
Any sign of your brother?
"Three of your five, what?"
So?
Come on!
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
Um. yeah.
"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?"
"Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!"
Me too!
"Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down."
Okay.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up."
Awwww.
Joey?
"Hi, sweetie!"
I've got some bad news.
"Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark."
"Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?"
"I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me."
Really!?
"Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?"
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'"
"Oh, that is so..."
"Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?"
What?!!
"Oh, hi."
"Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night."
"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
"But I told you, I didn't have the time!"
Just a job!
Well neither do I!
Oh my God.
"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
"Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called."
Nobody.
"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
Hey.
"Well, we never actually got to dinner."
"No, we kinda broke up instead."
"God, Monica it's on the ceiling."
"Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
No.
Okay.
Great!
"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
"Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit."
What's your problem?
I know.
"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no."
"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
"Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old."
Hey guys! What's...
"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!"
"Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it."
Foot rubs for a month!
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Yeah!!
"Well, I thought you liked doing it."
What was that?
You are soo enjoying this.
I think he's stealing from me.
Well where's Amanda?
"Ohh, that is soo sad."
What?
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
What-what are-what are these?
Oh my God! Look at this!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
And did you?!
"So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"
No we...
Yeah?
"But, but?"
Who was that?
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
Yeah.
What?!
"Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?"
"You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
"Well honey, what about you?"
Come on you gotta have one!
"Ross, you know what..."
"...if you tell me, I might do it."
"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
Pretty much.
"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
"No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this."
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Oww!
"I'm fine, I'm fine."
Yes I am!
"Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!"
"Look, either help me or go."
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Right.
I don't know.
"Oh, making it worse!"
"Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?"
You idiot!!
"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!"
Okay.
Ohhh!!!!
"Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!"
What?
"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
Oh my God.
"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
What did you just say?
"Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . ."
"Ohh, ohh."
"Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
Noo.
"Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know."
It was unbelievable!
"Did uh, Ross call?"
Oh my god.
"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape."
Not interested.
No.
"You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights."
Oh yeah.
I'll say.
Uh-huh.
Summer catalogue!
Wow!!
Ooohhhh!!
Hmm.
"Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!"
"Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!"
That's fine!
Chandler!!
"Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep."
"Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?"
"Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?"
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
"Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school."
They had to have that specially made?!
"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
