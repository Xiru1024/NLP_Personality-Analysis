"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
Going out with who?
Hey.
"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman s tux!"

"I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
"I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don t have to sell those cookies anymore."
And now you want that money back.
"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?"
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins stop it  now. What was Monica s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Correct. Rachel claims
It's not funny!

You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there."
"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice"
"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
Twice?
I m sorry I m a little late.
"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Nuh-uh.

"Oh well that?s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye."
Whazzup??
"You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Maybe?
"No,"
"So  Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it."
"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad."
Come on!
"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Yes, yes, that's right..."
"I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y know explain later."
"No you do y'know what, you re not gonna suck me into this."
"I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."
Thank you.
Isabella Rosselini.
Damn! I can t believe I took her off my list.
"Yeah, maybe."
What you don t think I d go up to her?
"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
What?!
I can t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I m a little mad at him now.
"Y know what? He didn t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don t talk to him"
"Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
It s-it s too soon.
No. I think you misunderstood what
What?! It is?!
"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,"
I got it.
Why?
Thanks a lot.
"Hey, uh, I m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
Hi! Sorry I m late. Were you sleeping?
"I got you the best one I could,  cause that s not where you want to skimp."
"Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?"
"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?"
"But ah, hey, oh, somebody s off the phone, how  bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again."
"Come on Rach, you don t have what, ten minutes?"
"What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?"
"Don t yell at me okay, this is the most I ve seen you all week."
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
Okay. This stuff?
Yes.
"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
"Uh sweetie, maybe you d be more comfortable here?"
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Unagi. I m always aware.
What s up?
"Oh, why don t you make her one of your little jokes."
I made it in the sixth grade.
"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
"Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me."
"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
So why don t you quit?
Who is Maria?
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Rach? Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
"I mean, I-I-I think she s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!"
"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""
How could I forget?
"Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
"Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh."
How come it s always us left in the field holding the ball?
"Oh yeah, I d love that."
And why do you care so much?
You had fantasies about Emily?
"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y know?"
What-what is love really?
"You don t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!"
"Y'know, hey! You re the one who ended it, remember?"

"Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing."
"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care I-I love Rachel."
"Oh but not that way. I mean I mean I m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend."
Hey! I offered to marry her!

I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
"Can't do it, can you?"
"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
"Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
"Hello?  No she can t come to the phone right now.  Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye."

"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
"Okay, quick and painful."
"Oh, what? What-what?"
"Hi! Hi, I m Ross, you don t know me, but I m a big, big fan of yours. I mean,"
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
"Um, yeah."

So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression

"So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there."

"Ah, must ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store."
Oh.
"Umm. Umm, I m-I m just gonna "
"No-no, I m I m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy."
Just ignore them.
What? What?
It s not something you are! It s something you have!
"Hi! I m so glad you re here, but it s gonna be a while. I-I wished you d called first."
Oh good.
"Okay, what s up?"
"Ma, you re asking me to marry you?"
Thanks.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Yeah?
What?! No!
I'll take sports.
"Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say"
What kind of father do you think I am?
Mine stole my newspaper! It s like a
"I mean, everyone should have a-a"
You like it?
"and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should ve just lasted just one day, burned for"
"That s right, and that s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end."
Yeah?
"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
Thank you.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
"I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?"
"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
Hey. Who s that?
"And-and another one had never been to a party before, so"
"Yeah, right!"
"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
"Well now let s-let s look at this objectively, I think I should date her"
"That s interesting, but check this out. I date her"
"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
"No Joey! Look why don t, why don t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we ll"
"Well sorry, that s what I do on dates."
So let s decide on the spending limit
"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,"
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Why am I not surprised?
I don t think you have much choice.
Bye-bye!
Dad?
Hey!
"Dad, we-we can t believe you re selling the house."
"Ok, got the vent open."
Hey! What's she doing back here?
"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar"
"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard"
Hey!
"Well, not playing raquetball!"
Do they wait for me to do this?
I can t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can t date. It s against the rules. It s forbidden."
What?
Really?
"Well I-I-I don t care how hot it is it s-it s uh, it s wrong."
No! No! It s wrong! It s-it s-it s naughty. It s taboo.
"Okay, okay, what's going on?"
"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
I wrote that out phonetically for you.
"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't"
Oh.  Oh-oh.
Done!
"And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"

Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
"Monica, you re so lucky! He s like the most popular guy in school!!"
I was just leaving.

"Y'know, hey! You re the one who ended it, remember?"
You still love me?
"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
Hey!
I don t know if it s true.
"Oh, okay, y know what this is?"
Well do you want some help?
"Excuse me. Hi, I m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?"
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Chandler s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
"It s okay. Come, come on in."
Oh.
"Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions."
"Yeah, most of it it's a place"
You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
Hey!
"Oh, yeah, no problems. It s all taken care of."

"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend."
"Yeah, that s the one. Listen, I don t want to hurt her."
"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
"Actually, no, we re not."
"No, we re not."
"No, we re not!!"
Right.
Emily!
"I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off."
"I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you."
Yeah?
"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her."
"Well, can you blame her?"
"Dad, dad I don t want to hear about it."
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
I do-I do
Am I giving out some kind of sexy professor vibe?

I made a promise that--Oh hey!

"Cassie, how you-how you doin  on that hot dog."
Thank God.
We re probably too old to do that now.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I ll always remember that summer because that s when I realized that we are related.
Hey.
Hey?
"Ahh, no."
"Honey, I love you too."
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
"You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
"You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
Hey!
She said what?
This isn t right.
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we re getting married.
No. I m saying it s now.
"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
No-o-o!  No way!
Hey!
"Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer."

"Okay, fine!"

"Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
"Ah  Ah Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion s views on evolution?"
I find Marion s views far too progressionist.
"I m a professor here uh, Ross Geller."
Yes! You re the person who checked out my book?!
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
This ship has sailed.

"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
"I m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y know, she"
"Yeah, we're better off without them."
"My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
My first time with Carol was...
Hi. Where is everybody?
"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
" Cause Carol s a lesbian.  And, and I m not one. And apparently it s not a mix and match situation."
"I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I d be out and she d, she d see some beautiful woman, and, and she d be Ross y'know look at her, and I d think, God, my wife is cool!"
"Well, now I do!!"
"I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!"
"I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
I feel stupid.
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Okay.
"Okay, I m gonna get your coat and then I ll-I ll put you in a cab."
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay?
You tell them to wait!
"Jen, I know this may sound a little  But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or"
Umm?
I will give you a call.
"No, no he s not."
"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of"
Where s Ben?
"Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
Please. This is so your fault.
Nope.
"Y know what, I don t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
"So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find"
"Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone s been doing their homework."
"and then, we could ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would ve been no problem?
"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I ve ever made."
Yeah.
"It s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
"It s a good thing I didn t do it, because it sounds like it would ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night"
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn t get messed up?
I just found out that Elizabeth s dad wants to meet me.
It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
"Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?"
"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!"
"And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work.  Now come on!"
Hi.
"I think we do. Why don t we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you re here."
"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That s been one heck of a see-saw hasn t it?"
"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate, but don t you think it s better if we just stayed friends?"
"In fact, I have some time right now."
"Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
Okay.
"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?"
Look at Emma!
It s it s complicated okay?
"Since Rachel and I we re doing really, we re doing really well right now."
You don t have a
"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble."
"How we doing, you guys ready?"
"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
No!
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
"Oh, you've tasted it."
Okay.
"Okay, go left. Left! Left!"
"No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even"
"Yes but too me he's just, man."
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
"What s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!"
"I mean, enough of the silliness!"
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don t ya?"
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there s a bug in my food.
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn t work."
Like me tiny doctor! 
"Hey, you guys! Guess what?"
Oh my god.
There's something new in the bowl.
"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
It's not the same.
We're here!
"Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?"
"He-he was with me umm, we re playing a little game, y know? Hide and seek."
Oh my God! Monica!
"Y know, I m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?"
"Yeah, like I could"
I played bad on purpose guys.
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."
"It s not for me, it s for Rachel."
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she s gonna want to move."
"Yeah, you didn t expect her to live there with a baby did you?"
"Fine, I m mentally unstable."
What?!
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it s-it s-it s, it s right there ."
Do you really?
"Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?"
Sweetie that s it.
You re welcome.
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer."
"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
Thanx.
"Yeah, come on in. Molly?"
"Okay, I know what I have to do. I ve got to go Red Ross.  Y know, Red Ross!"
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
"Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!"
Hi.
It tastes like feet!
She is not   She s gay. Oh my God. She is
I m sorry your husband cheated on you.
You chipped in?!
Hey!
"Do you have a minute? I d like to talk to you about something I m, I m really uncomfortable talking about."
Hmm?
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Yeah.
What?
"But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
"Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
It s a great class.
"Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?"
What are
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
"Perhaps. Now I m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to"
"Hey, did I do these neat enough?"
Yeah?
Sure. Why not?
Yeah?
Yeah sure.
Yeah.
"Okay, I gotta go."
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie."
What happened?
Hi Jill!
Hi .
"Rachel! Well, you-you re not at home, you re-you re-you re right here."
"Yes, yes it is. It s uh   Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!"
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn t bring you here so you can ambush her."
"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff."
"What do you mean, they re not moving in? They-they re still moving in right?"
What?! Over a stupid room!
Hi!
"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?"
Together? Like-like to people?
Okay.
"I mean, I don t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore."
Is this about Mark?
"Okay, it s not, it s not."
"Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!"
"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
Y know I don t understand why they didn t cry. It was a beautiful speech.
No!
Hi! It s me.
"Really? I ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don t, don t you think we can work on this?"
Is that Mark?
Yeah! Got it!
"Ah, that s okay, thanks."
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Really?!
Peach pit.
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
"Come on, two on one."
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
Why are we in bed together?
Yeah.
"I mean, I don t remember much about last night, it was such a blur."
And we didn t have sex.
"Okay, it s coffee."
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices."
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo..."
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately."
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
"Joey, get out of the fridge."
Save it.
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."
Yeah!
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
And it can't be Joey.
At the vet.
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
May I come in?
Do
I just want this to be  about what it is!
The physical act of love.
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but..."
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
Kinda like a big face without skin.
"Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?"
They re not listening too me?
"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?"
Does she.
"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
No. No.
Hi.
"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
How could I forget?
"Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
"Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh."
"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
"Then don't do that, alright?"
Monica. Whaddya think?
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
Peach pit.
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
My first time with Carol was...
"Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?"
"Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Nuh-uh.
"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh."
"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
Yeah.
"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
Thank you.
Oh my God..
"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
Kinda like a big face without skin.
"Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
"Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
"Thanks, man, big help."
"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
I know-
Chandler-
"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
She lent me an egg once.
"Aw, right."
An egg?
"Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend..."
Like buddies.
You know how close women can get.
Although I was married to her.
"Err, right."
What? What? What?
"Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
Im gonna be a father.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Tonight.
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
"Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
Uh-huh.
It's just a fur ball.
"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
"Alright boys, let's eat."
You still on that?
"You are way off, pal."
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me."
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
"What? It's, it's just a phase."
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
At the vet.
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
Where exactly is your zoo?
Yes.
"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
"Just, just say what you feel."
"I love it, when we share."
"Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
"What? Great, now I'm having a baby."
"Ooh, Ooh."
"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
"Joey, get out of the fridge."
She's not even here yet.
Please. This is so your fault.
"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
"Ok, got the vent open."
What kind of research?
"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
You're bleeding.
"Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
I didn't order lemonade.
"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach."
"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
What are you guys doing?
"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world."
"Hi, honey."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?"
Please tell me you're joking.
"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--"
"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility."
Hi everyone.
"Man, I sure miss Julie."
"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob."""
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here."
"Excellent, that was excellent."
I didn't get a cat.
"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Fine.
"Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . ."
"Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off."
"No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is."
You got me a cola drink?
Ok.
Ok.
"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
Mmm hmmm.
That is so good! Do it again!
Is everything ok?
What's the matter?
What?
Ok.
Yeah.
"No, that's fine."
That commercial always makes me so sad.
"Oh my God, what happened?"
I can't believe this.
"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
That guy Lipson?
Of course.
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
"This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year."
"Joey, some people don't like that."
What? Let me see.
What happened?
"Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?"
"Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii."
Hey guys.
"No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?"
Rach.
"I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
"I tell you, I've never seen him this happy."
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Who's drink can I freshen?
"Mon, Mon, are you OK?"
Yeah.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Shut up.
"Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi."
Hey you guys.
"Uh, sweetie we've gotta go."
Yeah alright.
"God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt."
"So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?"
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers."
"No, Rach!"
"Marenge,"
Hey!
"'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man."
"No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done."
Hello.
"Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
What?
Okay.
"Okay, that's, that's enough."
"Okay, I've got three of my five."
Okay!! Okay!!
Hi. Where is everybody?
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'"
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
"Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?"
Yeah.
"Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?"
"No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird"
"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs."
"No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
"Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going."
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Good for a scrud.
Hi there!
I'm so proud of you.
Hi.
Hello.
"Yeah, huh."
"Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm...."
"Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean..."
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger."
So I nodded off a little.
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
"Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island."
Hey.
"What is ah, Rach in her room?"
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
"Hey, honey."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Hey.
"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
"No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!"
"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
Is this about Mark?
"Okay, it's not, it's not."
"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
Hi! It's me.
"Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?"
Who's that?
Is that Mark?
Jasmine?
"Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!"
"No, no, no, this weekend guys!"
What's going on?
Where's Ben?
"Oh yeah, I'd love that."
"Oh, now you want a favour?"
"Yeah, you're right."
"We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you."
"Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?"
Okay.
"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?"
Pffhah.
Hello.
"Look, they must be stopped!"
I need juice! People need juice!!
"No, but it's-it's-it's hot!"
Hey.
"Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
"No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body."
"Come on you guys, it's no big deal!"
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory."
What's a koondis?
I guess it's worth a try.
Ow!!
"What was, what was that?"
What?! How's that?
Good night.
Okey-dokey!
Hello.
Hi!
"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore."
"Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?"
"Yeah, like I could lose it."
I played bad on purpose guys.
Hey!
"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?"
"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger."
Yeah.
"What's ah, what's so funny about that?"
"Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?"
"No, no, I'm serious. Thank you."
"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?"
"Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?"
"Uh, I don't know, whatever."
"Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!"
Yeah?
"So, then you can stay as long as you want."
"Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on."
What?!
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
"I'm getting married, to..day!!"
"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
"Wha... what, here?"
Ah....
Er.... um.....
"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
What're you talkin' about?
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Yeah.
No.
Nope.
What?
How could you have told her?
"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
No! You let go!
Hey!
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
"Oh my God, is that still..."
No you're not.
Rach!
Rachel...
Ohh.
I'm sweeping...
"Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?"
"Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning."
Hey!
I wasn't sleeping.
"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date."
What?

"Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Yes, yes, that's right..."
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
Is this about Mark?

"Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?"
You still love me?
"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
"This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!"

"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman s tux!"
That s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in.

"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!"
"The big deal is I don t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle beer! Cold beer."
I didn't wanna leave him alone.
"Oh, that'd be great!"
"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?"
"I m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square."

You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there."
"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice"
Why?
"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes."
"Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
"Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller."

"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
"Umm, he said he thought I was funny."
"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad."
"Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!"
"No, it s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don t"

"Ah  Ah Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion s views on evolution?"
I find Marion s views far too progressionist.
"I m a professor here uh, Ross Geller."
Yes! You re the person who checked out my book?!
"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
The point is I...
Fine.
Good.

"Uh, what?"
What You re not serious.
Hi roomie!
"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
"That s all right, we-we don t need you. In fact, hey I m over it already."
"Yeah, we're better off without them."
Divorced men s club.
"No no no, believe me."
You wanna explain that?
My first time with Carol was...
It was my
"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
" Cause Carol s a lesbian.  And, and I m not one. And apparently it s not a mix and match situation."
I m an idiot.
"Well, now I do!!"
Seven years.
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes."
"Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
Okay.
"Okay, I m gonna get your coat and then I ll-I ll put you in a cab."
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.

Okay!
"What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?"
Where s Ben?
"Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
Ah!  Oh.
"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
"Oh no-no-no, I m there."
"Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone s been doing their homework."
"Oh, I know.  Y know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda"
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would ve been no problem?
"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I ve ever made."
Yeah.
"I know, I know it was stupid."
"It s a good thing I didn t do it, because it sounds like it would ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night"
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn t get messed up?
That s all I m askin 
"Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me."
Thanks!
"Ah, what good are you."
Pass it! Pass it!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!  Ahh!
"I think we do. Why don t we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you re here."
"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That s been one heck of a see-saw hasn t it?"
"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate, but don t you think it s better if we just stayed friends?"
Okay.
Oh sure.
Okay.
Hmph.
I said '
"Oh what are you kidding? She s gorgeous, it s all Rachel."
"Look, we ve been together."
"Yeah, exactly."
What-what are you doing?! Are you Okay that s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
I was talking to myself! You re going down!
Some days it's all I can think about.
No!
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
"Oh, you've tasted it."
Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!"
"Yes but too me he's just, man."
"Ugh, can you believe that guy!"
"Huh, what s fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
"Well, apparently not, and I can t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly."
Okay-okay!
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don t ya?"
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
"Yeah, I m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say  Like me!"
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we re never gonna get along."
"Y'know what I didn t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You re not my girlfriend anymore so..."
There's something new in the bowl.
"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
It's not the same.
Thank you for a delightful stay.
"Long story, honey."
"He-he was with me umm, we re playing a little game, y know? Hide and seek."
"You re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad."
Great. He s doing great. Don t you worry about Chandler.
"Yeah, like I could"
I played bad on purpose guys.
"Yeah no, just that last song."
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."
"It s not for me, it s for Rachel."
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she s gonna want to move."
"Yeah, you didn t expect her to live there with a baby did you?"
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You re an ezel!
What?!
Crack isn t even an intravenous drug!
Do you really?
"Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?"
Sweetie that s it.
You re welcome.
"Yeah, that s our baby."
"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
"Well, I m not going to go now anyway ."
Thanx.
"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?"
"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem."
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him."
That cup is mine!
Guess what?
Are you kidding?
I m sorry your husband cheated on you.
Try telling my wife that.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
"Do you have a minute? I d like to talk to you about something I m, I m really uncomfortable talking about."
"I actually had a topic in mind! I m, I m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise."
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Yeah.
What?
No.
"Well, I think it's perfect."
"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
You're kidding.
All right.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
All right here. Watch me execute the three  P s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.
"Yeah, yeah, I was watching."
No. No-no. No. What would
"Yeah, I recognize the ankles!"
"Perhaps. Now I m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to"
"I m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I look, I just want you guys to be safe."
Yeah?
Sure. Why not?
Yeah?
"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn t invite her?"
"Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want."
I know.
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie."
"Well, yeah."
"Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
Hi .
"Rachel! Well, you-you re not at home, you re-you re-you re right here."
"Okay. So well I ll umm,  I ll have her home by midnight."
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn t bring you here so you can ambush her."
That bitch!
"What do you mean, they re not moving in? They-they re still moving in right?"
What?! Over a stupid room!
"Oh no, yeah no, that part s great!"
"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?"
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Okay.
"Uh sure, sure."
Is this about Mark?
"Okay, it s not, it s not."
"Fine, you re right."
"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
"Yes, you can, very much."
Hey!
"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y know?"
"Really? I ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don t, don t you think we can work on this?"
Who s that?
Yeah! Got it!
"Ah, that s okay, thanks."
"Look, I don t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?"
Really?!
Sweet!
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine."
"Come on, two on one."
"What, now?"
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Yeah.
No!
And we didn t have sex.
Tell me about it.
It s-it s hot
"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo..."
"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately."
"Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it s gonna make a difference"
"Yeah, save it for the cab, okay."
"Joey, get out of the fridge."
What is that?
"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."
"That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on."
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
And it can't be Joey.
Or Joseph.
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Do
So do I.
The physical act of love.
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but..."
"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
Kinda like a big face without skin.
"Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?"
"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Does she.
"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
No. No.
Hi.
"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh..."
Pregnant?!
"Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
"Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh."
"Quack, quack.."
"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
Monica. Whaddya think?
Wh- are you welling up?
"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine."
"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
My first time with Carol was...
It was my first time.
"The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Nuh-uh.
"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
Yeah.
"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Yes, yes, that's right..."
Yeah?
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in."
"Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
Really?
"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid."
"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
I know-
Chandler-
Joey-
"Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
She lent me an egg once.
"Aw, right."
Hey.
I think it's insane.
Like buddies.
You know how close women can get.
Although I was married to her.
"Err, right."
A little.
"Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
I see. So what do you propose to do?
"I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me."
Tonight.
You take your time.
"Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush."
"Oh, we just..."
Do you have a point?
"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
"No, why?"
You still on that?
"You are way off, pal."
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Hey.
Alright.
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
What?
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
I'm gonna have to give him up.
Yes.
"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
That was good.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
"Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
"Ooh, Ooh."
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
"Yeah, save it for the cab, okay."
What is that?
Where the hell have you been?
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
"Yeah, Susan."
You wanna explain that?
"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that."
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Yeah.
"Come on, they're gonna love you."
You're bleeding.
"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
Thank you.
"It was you, pal."
But...
"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
Okay.
"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world."
Carol?
Hello to the rest.
You don't believe in evolution?
Please tell me you're joking.
"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--"
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
What?
"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
"What guys? Oh, yeah."
"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Good.
"Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off."
"No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is."
"It uhh, it won't go back."
"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
"Oh, you and me?"
"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Uh-huh.
"No no, that's me."
Oh my god.
What?
"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?"
Yeah.
"No, that's fine."
Ok.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
I can't believe this.
"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
Zoo dollars?
"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
That guy Lipson?
"No, I, I only know Lipson."
This is unbelievable.
But you already told me everything.
"Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?"
What? Let me see.
Hi Tushie.
What?
"Wha, OK, now how do you know that?"
"Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold."
"No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today."
"Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect."
I'm done.
You're not laughing.
We're not alone.
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
"C'mon, it's my birthday."
"Mon, Mon, are you OK?"
Yeah.
Eww.
Shut up.
Mi-mi-mii.
Did you see me write one down?
"Uh, sweetie we've gotta go."
No?
"Oh, sorry we didn't know."
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Alright.
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Yeah.
"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers."
"No, Rach!"
"Marenge,"
Everybody!
Why aren't you guys dressed?
"No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done."
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
"Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!"
What?
What are you talking about?
"Okay, that's, that's enough."
Won't you dance around with me.
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
"Heavy thing, not getting lighter!"
"Well, now I do!!"
"Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
"Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels."
"Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?"
Yeah.
"Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?"
And what is second prize?
"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs."
"No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
"Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going."
All right!!
Not nice enough.
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
"Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency."
"Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so..."
Hello.
"Yeah, huh."
What?
"Oh, well..."
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger."
"What should I wear, now I'm all nervous."
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
"First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly."
"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island."
"No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it."
"What is ah, Rach in her room?"
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
What's that on the bottom?
"Hey, what's going on?"
"What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?"
"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
Yes.
Is this about Mark?
"Okay, it's not, it's not."
"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do."
"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?"
"Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?"
Who's that?
Is that Mark?
Yeah! Got it!
"We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller."
"No, no, no, this weekend guys!"
What's going on?
"So, for the whole weekend?"
"Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
"Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
"We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you."
"Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk."
Okay.
"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?"
So I'm gonna take off then!
"Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap."
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
I need juice! People need juice!!
People need juice!
I can't believe no one believes me!
"Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
"No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body."
"Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out."
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
"Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?"
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
No?
Gimme this.
I guess it's worth a try.
What?! What?!
"What was, what was that?"
What?! How's that?
Hey!
Okey-dokey!
Yeah.
We'd like to close our accounts.
Wow! You-you look great!
"Yeah, okay."
"Yeah, like I could lose it."
I played bad on purpose guys.
"Yeah-no, just that last song."
What are you doing?
"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
You've sentenced him?!
Yeah.
They're not a couple!
"Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so..."
"I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks."
"It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not."
"Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
"Uh, I don't know, whatever."
"Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!"
Yeah?
"Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day."
"Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!"
"No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy."
No! No! That's-that's time-out!
"I'm getting married, to..day!!"
"Ahh, whoo-hoo!!"
"Wha... what, here?"
Ah....
Er.... um.....
Um... uh.... vulva.
"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
"Yeah, which was nice."
Thanks.
"Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?"
Yeah.
What?
Nope.
What?
"Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?"
"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
Hey! It's starting to snow.
I'm gonna be on TV!!
"Oh my God, is that still..."
No you're not.
Rach!
Rach...
Fine. I'll go.
Okay. This stuff?
"Sweep, sweep...."
"Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning."
Okay.
"I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?"
"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date."
"Y'know, you're right. Thank you."
What?
Are we really in Montreal?!
"Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
"Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Yes, yes, that's right..."
What? Ow!
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
Fine.
"Okay, it's not, it's not."
"Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!"
"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
"Hey, you're right."
You're over me?
"When, when were you... under me?"
"OK, I need to lie down."
You still love me?
"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
What?!
You guys.
"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'."
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben."
No?
"Oh look, a low budget puppet show."
I'll make some calls.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Yeah.
Hmm?
"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
You get the dollhouse.
Hi.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
Ohhhhh!
"Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!"
Why? Did you write it?
"Well ah, actually..."
"I do not always have to be-okay, okay."
"So uh, Emily just went to the airport."
I made fun of his accent.
Hi!
"Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I..."
Hi.
How d did it go?
I m so proud of you.
"Listen, I m ah, I m sorry I ve been so crazy and jealous and, it s just that I like you a lot, so..."
Yeah.
I know.
"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""Hey, you're not Bob."""
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Yeah?
"Uhh,"
What?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Why?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Yep! That's hilarious!
"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Is that so?
Oh yeah! Wasn t she uh
"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman s tux!"
That s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in.
So?
I do.
Uh-huh.
"Well, I m-I m just glad I could, y know, help you out."
"Hero, I uh, I don t know well, all right."
It was. It was an amazing night.
Yeah.
Here you go.
"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!"
And now you want that money back.
"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?"
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice"
Why?
What was with the dishes?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Nuh-uh.
"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
No.
"Yes, exactly!"
"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I d have to talk you into this more."
I m asking you to do me a favor.
"I don t know, something girlie."
What?
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad."
"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Yes, yes, that's right..."
"Oh, I hate this story."
That little naked guy would be me.
"No you do y'know what, you re not gonna suck me into this."
"I do not always have to be okay, okay."
"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!"
Damn! I can t believe I took her off my list.
What you don t think I d go up to her?
"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
"Okay, hold my crawler."
What?!
I can t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I m a little mad at him now.
"Y know what? He didn t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don t talk to him"
That s right!
"Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?"
"Come on Rach, you don t have what, ten minutes?"
"What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?"
"Don t yell at me okay, this is the most I ve seen you all week."
"Yeah, but wait..."
"I don t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then."
Focus.
Okay. This stuff?
All right.
"Uh sweetie, maybe you d be more comfortable here?"
"Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering."
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Unagi. I m always aware.
What s up?
"Oh, why don t you make her one of your little jokes."
Why not?
"Oh great! What, you brought Joey?"
"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
So why don t you quit?
Who is Maria?
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
So you re strong enough to face her on your own?
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""
Oh.
You had fantasies about Emily?
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y know?"
What-what is love really?
I am a good kisser.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this
"Y'know, hey! You re the one who ended it, remember?"
You still love me?
You still love me.
"Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
What?!
What?
When did I say you were boring?!
Phoebe! You and I have
"Ah, we re out. I sold them all."
"Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck."
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Why not? It s built into the price of the room.
Thread!
What disposable cameras?
No you didn t.
No. Sorry man.
"Well, I m sure they re still somewhere here in the hotel. I ll-I ll help you look for them."
"It s possible, they have really sharp edges."
Y know what? You re just upset because you re losing.
You don t think it s a little crazy that you get all my points just  cause you
"Phoebe, what happened?"
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
Celebrities I m allowed to sleep with.
"Okay, Elizabeth Hurely...."
Susan Sarandon.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
"No, come on don t start.  Ouch!"

"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"

"J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that"
Okay.
Action.
"Dude, you are sick."
"You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
"Hey, I thought I cheered you up."
Right. Good night.
"All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application."
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
"Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room."
"No Phoebe, don t look! You don t want to see what s under there!!"
Hot dog?
"I gotta tell you, I-I wasn t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn t expecting to like anyone right now, but she s really terrific."
"No, I-I m saying I liked her."
"Pheebs, I think she s great. Okay? We re going out again."
Five letters.
"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what s wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
"Yeah, but this can t be it, I mean."
Yeah?
I really think they re out of rooms.
What-what?
"Okay, quick and painful."
"Oh, what? What-what?"
...Yeah?
"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?"
"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
"I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
Yeah but
Huh. Y know what s not one of a kind? A twin!
"Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?"
"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
Hey.
"No, I don t want to hit you."
No.
Oh fine.
What? What?
Thanks.

Thank you.
"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good."
Green. To the green.
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
Hey.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
"Yeah, right!"
"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
"Well now let s-let s look at this objectively, I think I should date her"
"That s interesting, but check this out. I date her"
"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
"No Joey! Look why don t, why don t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we ll"
Maybe I ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
"Well sorry, that s what I do on dates."
So let s decide on the spending limit
I was thinking more like a hundred.
"No that s not what I want. Uh, I m glad you guys were bonding but I"
"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,"
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Why am I not surprised?
I don t think you have much choice.
Bye-bye!
"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard"
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Why would I tell him?
Is it? Feels like two.
Oh. Hel-lo!
"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don t I have to wait a while?"
"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
Wow. What does

"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole  Does it?  part just another glance."
"No, Rach, no. I don t, I don t, I don t"
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
What are you doing?
"Rachel, this is your apartment."
Who s Chip?
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
"Monica, you re so lucky! He s like the most popular guy in school!!"
Why? Did you write it?
You still love me?
"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
What?!
"Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and"
I don t know if it s true.
"Oh, okay, y know what this is?"
"All right. All right, I ll do it."
Well do you want some help?

"Yeah, most of it it's a place"
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
Ok.
"Oh, yeah, no problems. It s all taken care of."
"Oh yeah, why not?"
I didn t get the annulment.

"Rach, I got a message from you."
You're over me?
"Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
"When, when were you... under me?"
Really? That's great!
"Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
"Look, I-I m really sorry I let go of the bike."
"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were"
Phoebe.
"Because! Because, it-it-it s  It d be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar"
Great! Great!  You re making the bike very happy.
That s cool.
They re not a couple!

"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."
I have a bone to pick with you.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
That s right! That s right!
What am I going to do?
I don't know you guys.
Great. Great.
"Yeah. Tell ya what, let s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!"

What? Is it the comet?
"Joey come I can t believe I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!"
Show me where?
Joey where s the pipe that was holding the door open?

"It s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!"
What?
"Joey, we"
"Well, John McClane had plans!"
"Uh, yeah, I ll take a coffee. Thanks, man."
What?
"Hey, y'know while we re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don t live here anymore."
"Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
It really was.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
"Okay.  Wow, it s-it s 5:30 in the morning.  So, I d better get cracking on this baby."
"Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"
No! No! No!
"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
"That's okay, Joe."
"Hey, it s been like three weeks!"
You're nose is bleeding!
Umm
"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore."
Dude! How-how did you write this?
All the time?
Hey.
Hey?
Are you jealous?
You are totally jealous.
"Honey, I love you too."
"Umm, she kissed me."
What are you doing?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
No-o-o!  No way!
Hey!
"Hey, it s my list."
Need some help?
"Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?"
"Oh, now you want a favour?"
I don t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she s totally freaked out!
Rachel!
Okay!
You bug me.

Hey!

Fine.
Good.
A
"Uh, what?"
Chandler s gone again!
"Yeah, we're better off without them."
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
You wanna explain that?
"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
It was my
"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
" Cause Carol s a lesbian.  And, and I m not one. And apparently it s not a mix and match situation."
"Well, now I do!!"
Okay.
"Okay, I m gonna get your coat and then I ll-I ll put you in a cab."
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay?
"What?! I wh-, what s wrong?"
"Yeah, Susan."
"Joey, uh-"
"Y know what, I don t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would ve been no problem?
"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I ve ever made."
Yeah.
"I know, I know it was stupid."
"It s a good thing I didn t do it, because it sounds like it would ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night"
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn t get messed up?
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Pass it! Pass it!
Hi.
"I think we do. Why don t we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you re here."
"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That s been one heck of a see-saw hasn t it?"
"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate, but don t you think it s better if we just stayed friends?"
Oh sure.
"Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
Okay.
Hmph.
"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?"
Look at Emma!
"Oh what are you kidding? She s gorgeous, it s all Rachel."
It s it s complicated okay?
"Yeah, exactly."
You don t have a
What-what are you doing?! Are you Okay that s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble."
And in about five seconds you re gonna see why.
Now I m so happy.
It's breast milk.
No!
How's the hair?
"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen."
"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there s a bug in my food.
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn t work."
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we re never gonna get along."
"Y'know what I didn t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You re not my girlfriend anymore so..."
There's something new in the bowl.
"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
It's not the same.
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
"Yeah, cheerie-o!"
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."
"It s not for me, it s for Rachel."
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she s gonna want to move."
"Yeah, you didn t expect her to live there with a baby did you?"
Crack isn t even an intravenous drug!
"Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  it s-it s-it s, it s right there ."
Do you really?
"Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?"
Sweetie that s it.
You re welcome.
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer."
"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
"Well, I m not going to go now anyway ."
"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?"
Uh Rach
They don t look any bigger than me!
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
That cup is mine!
She is not   She s gay. Oh my God. She is
I m sorry your husband cheated on you.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
"Do you have a minute? I d like to talk to you about something I m, I m really uncomfortable talking about."
"I actually had a topic in mind! I m, I m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise."
Hmm?
"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Yeah.
What?
No.
"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
You're kidding.
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
All right.
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!"
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
What are
"Yeah, I recognize the ankles!"
"Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus."
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie."
"Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
Who cares? I repel women.
"Rachel! Well, you-you re not at home, you re-you re-you re right here."
Or that.
"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn t bring you here so you can ambush her."
"Hi Frannie, congratulations."
"What do you mean, they re not moving in? They-they re still moving in right?"
What?! Over a stupid room!
Is this about Mark?
"Okay, it s not, it s not."
"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard."
"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y know?"
Hi! It s me.
Really?!
Sweet!
"Uh actually, sorry I can t even make it. I m seeing Mona again tonight."
I know. My arm is killing me.
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
Why are we in bed together?
Yeah.
And we didn t have sex.
Hey.
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices."
What the hell happened on that beach?!
What is that?
Save it.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Yeah!
"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
And it can't be Joey.
Or Joseph.
Do
The physical act of love.
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?"
They re not listening too me?
"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."
"Then don't do that, alright?"
Wh- are you welling up?
You're gonna be an aunt.
What?
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
"Joey, uh- OMnipotent."
"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
It was my first time.
"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good."
Green. To the green.
Nuh-uh.
"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
Yeah.
"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
I know-
"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
Hello!
"I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me."
"No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt."
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Tonight.
Uh-huh.
Do you have a point?
It's just a fur ball.
"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
"No, why?"
You still on that?
Hey.
Alright.
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
What?
"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
"Just, just say what you feel."
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
I thought that was just a rumour.
"What? Great, now I'm having a baby."
"Ooh, Ooh."
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
What is that?
Save it.
That would be nice.
What kind of research?
"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that."
You're bleeding.
"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
"It was you, pal."
I didn't order lemonade.
But...
"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten."
"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
Please tell me you're joking.
"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--"
What's wrong with people having sex?
I know.
"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob."""
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
I didn't get a cat.
"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
There was never a good time.
Fine.
Good.
"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
"No no, that's me."
I know.
"Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday."
With mealworms.
"Joey, some people don't like that."
Hi Tushie.
"Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?"
"Wha, OK, now how do you know that?"
"Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money."
"Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them."
"Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?"
"Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect."
Sorry.
You're not laughing.
"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
Yeah.
Get the what?
Shut up.
Did you see me write one down?
"Look, you wanna get off my back?"
What woman?
"My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen."
No?
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
"Okay, good luck"
"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers."
"Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind."
Hey!
Really.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Hello.
What?
"Okay, that's, that's enough."
Won't you dance around with me.
"Well, now I do!!"
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'"
"Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Oh.
"Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm...."
"Oh, well..."
"Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean..."
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger."
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island."
Is everything okay?
Hey.
"What is ah, Rach in her room?"
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
What's that on the bottom?
"Hey, honey."
"Hey, what's going on?"
"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
Is this about Mark?
"Okay, it's not, it's not."
"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do."
"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?"
Hi! It's me.
Is this about Mark?
Is that Mark?
"No, no, no, this weekend guys!"
What a pity stay?
Pffhah.
Still?!
"Look, they must be stopped!"
I need juice! People need juice!!
People need juice!
Hey.
"Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
"Come on you guys, it's no big deal!"
Yeah.
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Are you serious?
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
What are you doing?
"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?"
"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
You've sentenced him?!
"Oh, who? Me?"
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
"Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!"
"Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
I'm kinda beat.
People can hear you.
They're not a couple!
Oh yeah!
Happy for you.
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
"I'm getting married, to..day!!"
Grazie.
"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
What was with the dishes?
You need to get some sleep.
"Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
Yeah.
Nope.
What?
"Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?"
"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
No! You let go!
Hey!
I'm gonna be on TV!!
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
"Oh my God, is that still..."
No you're not.
Rach!
Okay. This stuff?
"Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?"
"Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, sure! I'm sure."
What happened?
I wasn't sleeping.
"Y'know, you're right. Thank you."
I do.
"Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Yes, yes, that's right..."
"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
No!!
She was...
You think?
"Hey, you're right."
"When, when were you... under me?"
"Really. It's always been you, Rach."
You still love me?
"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
What?!
"This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
You guys.
That only took me an hour.
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
No?
"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel."
I'll make some calls.
Is this what you had in mind?
Yeah.
You get the dollhouse.
"Hey, what's this?!"
This is the coolest house ever!!
Hi.
Hi.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
"Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room."
"No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!"
Who's Chip?
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Why? Did you write it?
"Well ah, actually..."
"No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this."
"So uh, Emily just went to the airport."
What?
