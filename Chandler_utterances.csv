utterance
also I was the point person on my company s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
That I did. That I did.
My duties?  All right.
I see.
Good to know.
No don t I beg of you!
"Hey, Mon."
Do I ever.
No way!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Can I get a beer.
You betcha!
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
The whole thing! Can we go?
"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
"Okay, that s enough honey!"
"Great! Okay, here."
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
I'm back.
"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
Hey!
"That s great, but shouldn t you be on the toilet right now?"
This sounds like a hernia. You have to you-you go to the doctor!
"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do""."
"Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?"
Thanks man.
"No, no, you re right, it is a ridiculous name!"
Tickets please!  That s courtside baby!
"Oh, seriously you want him?"
Hey.
I couldn t do it.
"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!"
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
"No. No, not at all, that s-that s ridiculous."
Hey Bob.
"If I see him, I ll ask."
Yeah!
We re on a semi-first name basis.
"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don t know if he has what it takes."
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
What?
You can t wear that! I m wearing the famous tux! James Bond s tux!
"Sorry, I just don t like the idea of when I say ""I do,"" he s thinking, ""Yeah, I d do her too!"""
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
That's it?
"You ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
"Y'know, I, I really don t think we need a canoe."
"Okay. Then I guess it s just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
"Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen."
Hey.
She?
"I don t know.  I can t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that s because I didn t send him an invitation."
I don t even know the man. Okay? We re not that close. I haven t seen him in years.
"I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
"All right, there s a nuclear holocaust, I m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?"
I ve got canned goods.
Hey!
Y know I m-I m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Y know I was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
That s me! Come on!
"Ahh, come on! Y know what y know what, I think I m just gonna go home and call Kathy."
"And then after that, I m gonna get so drunk, I m gonna wanna call Janice"
Joe?
"Uh, you ve had a lot of sex right?"
"There huh hmm, there-there was an incident."
It s happened to you?
"Take whatever you want, just please don t hurt me."
"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Exactly.
"You don t want to be guys, you d be all hairy and wouldn t live as long."
I respectfully disagree.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?"
"Y know what you should do, just toss  em in the shedder and claim you never got  em."
"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!"
"Hey, I've been honing!"
"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Yuh-huh.
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear you want it to be dirty?
"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
You think we're ready for something like that?
"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
I'm not moving out.
"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
"Well, I just thought it d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
Oh no-no-no.
"Well, y know I m 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
You mean with Casey.
Or Casey.
Could be Casey.
"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?"
I like her.
"All right, I'm nine years old."
"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
Janice I didn t even know you were pregnant! Who s the unwitting human who s essence you ve stolen?
What?!
"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
Hey!
"Well, let s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
When did that happen to you?!
"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
No.
"How many times have I told you guys, you"
Hey!
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
"Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
Why?
"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
"No, no, no."
"Uh, uh."
"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
You mean they like you.
"Well, I don t have to buy that, ""I m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
"All right, look, you re not really gonna buy that are you? Don t you think you ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
"It s a nickname, I ll explain later."
"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
Look at this!
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
"I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
Hey.
What?!
"Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?"
I can t figure out what to make Monica.
"Wait a minute, I can t give this to her."
Paper cut!
"No, I don t want to tell anybody else because I don t want Monica to find out."
"Well, it s because I trust you, you re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
Me too.
Hey.
Oh all right.
What?
"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I ve missed the last 1200 times."
You don t think I ve tried? You think I
"Oh Maria. You can t say no to her, she s like this lycra spandex covered gym treat."
No!
"So do you think uh, Joey s more charming than me?"
Umm?
Have you seen Joey?
"Oh, just this!  Y know what it s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we"
What s going on?
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
"Okay, that hurt us."
"Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to"
"Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
The key s stuck in the lock.
"I know you can t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I d try and apologize over the phone."
How long have we been home?
Okay to come in?
"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
I m the ruptured spleen.
Because you shouldn t be with him.  You should be with me.
"Or with the other two women, in the morning y know I was just lying there and I couldn t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y know with a friend."
"I know you probably don t want to go out with me, y know because I make too many jokes and I ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I m not technically a ""doctor """
"No, there were two."
Okay.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
"So, how many have you sold so far?"
Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Yeah but you don t need  What is this?
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
So you don t have the cameras?!
So? What? What? They re gone! Monica s gonna freak!
This game makes no sense!
"Oh come on Ross, I think we re all losers here."
Let me think. Let me think Oh! I don t care.
"Either, it makes no difference."
This game is kinda fun.
"Oh come on guys, it s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And"
Am I naked again?!
"Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?"
"Oh, I ll go out and get you some."
"Nope! Because I m not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?"
"Umm, this is nice."
"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
"Okay, I m not gonna have one."
"So, let's go."
"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
"Eh, y'know what, she s to political, she probably wouldn t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she s too international, y'know she s never gonna be around."
"You're like the boom, boom, ... boom."
"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
I'm fine.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
How do you do that?
You win.
"Okay, now much have you won so far?"
Not 700 exactly?
Double it!
"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
"What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?"
"Joey, why is your cable out?"
What are you writing?
You want it?
"Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?"
"All right look, I m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
"What I do do is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me."
Hardest thing I ve ever done in my life.
Oh!
Where have you been?
"All right ladies, here s what we re gonna do."
"Oh, that s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
"You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
Janice?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
"Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
"Oh, that s uh, that s pretty nice but I m gonna go with the one I picked first."
What?
They put you in jail?
"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
You re building a post office?
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
I can t seem to say goodbye.
Y know what? Forget it!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
I don't think so!
"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
"Oh,"
"Yeah, well  Y know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
"Oh that s great, my friend Joey s in the movie business."
"Yeah, I ve always hated that Howie."
The nerve huh?
What?!
Hey.
"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor s Guild."
"""Benefits lapsed."""
"Okay, it s not a check. They re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn t work enough last year."
"I m sorry man, there s never a good time to  stop catching on fire."
"I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
No.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
What do you say?
Here it is! Here it is!
"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go."
Oh I m sorry! Do you need a break?
Do you know what just happened?
"Where you going, Joe?"
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Your thoughts? Plural?
"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached"
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
What are you doing here?
"Well, like father, like son."
Really?! I-I thought you weren t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
"Oh, that's"
"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!"
"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Are you serious?
It happened in London.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
"All right, call it in the air."
Heads it is.
We have to assign heads to something.
Well you did pull his hair.
I m not getting into this again!
I think that s gum.
There s no back to this couch!
"Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn t think I was y know, all dead inside."
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we re up at the altar and I m like this."
"The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
Thanks.
"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the"
Please tell me you got the message!
"The actor playing Mac couldn t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o clock."
"Hey, this is so unfair!"
"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
Hey!
No.
Just act like you belong.
Shh!  Nice to see you again.
"Yes, of course."
I do?
Here I am.
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
"Ross, ten o'clock."
"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!"
"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
"I am so, so, so, so sorry!"
"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!"
"Come on Monica, it s our Valentine s Day. Please? Please-please, please?"
"We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine."
"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
That's patio furniture!
What about the birds?
You pick one.
"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
That was amazing!
That was amazing.
"No, you're the best."
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Let's go!
"Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve."
I don't think so.
Here just take this.
Okay.
Hey!!
"Well, thank you for lunch."
All right! I found one that fits!
Really?
"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
"Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!"
It's your timer.
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
Hello children!
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
You mean this.
"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!"

"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
Really?!
"I don t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
"Well, you-you know what I meant."
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Monica!
"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was"
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
Yes please.
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
"Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?"
8. 8!
"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
I am
"Really? Okay, so"
"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
No. Not anymore.
"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."

"No no no... I mean,"
What!?
"I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date..."
"Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
Do not speak ill of the dead.
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y know, technically we still"
 Kay!
"Uhh, no."
No.
Yes.
"Umm ma am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don t think I can move to Tulsa."
"I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I d move to Tulsa, I didn t really  know what I was saying."
Tulsa is Italy Please don t make me go  there!
"There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and"
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000."
Oh yes!
Okay.
4:00 A.M.
Hey!
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Let me see the earrings.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
No!
That was Joey!
Really?
"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
Secret? Married people aren t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
"No I m serious, we should tell each other"
"Oh no-no, I can t do that."
Okay.
"So, Ross and I are going to"
"No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe s secret?"
"Listen, I ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
"No, I let him win Ross!"
Would you tell her I let you win please?
I am strong! I ll show you!
Oh what s the matter? Are you scared?
Right here!
"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
Okay.
"Yes, if it really doesn t mean anything, because you know that I m just not ready"
Totally.
"Yeah, it s beautiful."
"Yes, but there s two in martini, soo everybody"
"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
"Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can t believe that I ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
"Well, you re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes"
You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I ll be living here.
"Yeah, it s a very large plane."
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
"Chandler s funny, sophisticated, and he s very loveable, once you get to know him."
"Okay, great."
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
"Goin  out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
What?
Wait! You re going out with Kathy!
"Well, I m upset for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she s-she s smart, and funny, and gets you."
"We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
Oh!  She s growing inside you.
Oh!
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
It s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
"Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he s wrong."
"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?"
"All right. Look, I m gonna go in here, and you don t buy me anything ever."
Why not?!
What is the thing?

I'm intrigued.
"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
"Okay, we have to talk. I m just getting out of a very serious relationship"
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
"I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
"No! No! Not, Paris."

But we should take it.
Why?
"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
"Well, you're gonna."
"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
Yeah. I really do.
Yes that was mine.
See you later.
"So, what do you think?"
"What, like a number?"
"Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
"Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Give him money? It was a joke!
"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."

Does it bug you?
"Well, I feel like a snack!"
Oh no thanks. I don t like
"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny."
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Ow!
"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!"
I broke up with her.
"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
You re a genius!
"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
Hey Bobby.
"Uhh yeah. Yeah, it s  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?"
"Okay Bob listen uhh, I m the reason you didn t get the job up here."
"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
That she left you for another woman that likes women?
"Okay, absolutely!"
You ve got it.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Should we tell Rachel there s an empty private room right next door to hers?
"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
Oh my good God.
"Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
He's open!
I know!
Okay.
"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
"And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
You know.... You don't know!
"Oh, yeah?"
I m not crazy about babies. I m crazy about us.
"I still don t get it, we didn t do anything wrong."
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
"Hey, my Father s house does that!"
Nice try.
"Look, Monica"
This is not going to work.
You are so great! I love you!
"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
No I didn't!
No I didn't!
"So, you still don t think I m boyfriend material?"
Hi.
You mind if I
"So uh, what are you in for?"
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
That s laughter.
I don t know.
What are you doing?
Don t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Hey!
"I just came over to drop off nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?"
"So, I guess this is over."
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
Really? Okay. Great!
We're in a relationship?
What?
"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
There's a forest right outside.
Whose is it?
"Look, I m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
Not once did we do that.
Hi!
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing."
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Hey!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
"So you uh, want to do something tonight?"
"I mean, I remember a time when"
"Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?"
I bet he can.
"Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
Yeah!
I have no name.
"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
"Ow, no  woo-hooing,  no  woo-hooing. "
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey s sister.  Well, that s not the worst part."
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
"Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.."
Having a swim.
Chicks don t swim.
I don t know. Should we try it?
"See, I told you they don t swim."
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
"All right, let me in."
I'm not a dropper!
It's throwing and catching!
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
No-no Really?!
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh"
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
"This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?"
I did.  But it came at a price.
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like"
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let s discuss it before we reject it completely."""
"So, that s it?"
Which is why
"I don t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
I don't know.
"Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."
No!
"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
I m leaning. This is where I lean.
Brenda a bee!
Yes! It s flown into your blouse and you d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
You do?
"He s not gonna make it, he s stuck in Chicago."
What are you doing tonight?
Dude! Dude!
"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00."
"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
"Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do."
I would really love it if I could do both.
What?
What?!
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
"Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
"Man to uh, me."
"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
Ohhh. Don t go.
I don t care!  I don t care!!
You think?
"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can t do it. Monica has to work."
Oh uh well tomorrow s no good for her either.
It s the semi-finals of her botchy ball tournament.
Well now-now you re just talking crazy.
Yeah.
You still haven t told Rachel you weren t really  proposing?
"Joey, you have to tell her what s going on! And what did it  look like?!"
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
"When you re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too."
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough."
"I think it s great. It s great. Y know, they re thinking of changing the name of this place."
"Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And"
That s a mailman! That s
"Eh..., I don t, I don t know."
"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby."
"No, the little girl creeps me out."
"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Really?
We said seven!
Oh my good God.
"No, I m afraid I won t be able to make love as well as him."
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
"We share a wall! So either he s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
But in very different ways.
"If they can t find a home for her, they kill her! And I m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!"
Okay. And it s not just chicks y'know? It s all kinds of other animals!
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
"Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?"
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I m-I m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name."
"Ginger. I m talking to Ginger, so...."
You're definitely scaring here.
Hey.
"I m never gonna find a roommate, ever."
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing"
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
"Oh, y know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
"Oh well, that s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!"
"Yeah, like in a cab..."
You know it?
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
Might wanna try Joseph.
Hang on buddy!
Wow! Fortunately she has a
"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!"
Put Joey on the phone.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
What are you guys doing?
"Oooh, I m afraid that does not exist."
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who s going like this"
"I don t know what it is, I just can t take a good picture."
"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
"Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
"Hey, this is so unfair!"
"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
He's open!
'Scuse me.
"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
Thanks.
"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Where are they? Where are they?
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Here we go.
What?
What... did you get me there?
That's great.
That's it?
"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
How do you do that?
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
You're definitely scaring here.
"Hey, it's me."
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Put Joey on the phone.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
You did?
"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
"...Quality, right, great."
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
What?
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
I'm not moving out.
I'm sorry!
"Rachel, wait, wait."
"Well, you're gonna."
What? What?
Janice?
Can we start over?
"And to you too, Helen."
"Oh, okay. Send her in."
"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
"Mr. D, hows it going, sir?"
And?
So what does this mean?
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
"Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me."
"Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?"
"Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us."
"Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise."
"Sure, why not?"
"Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?"
"Well, I ended up telling her everything."
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
"Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
What's up with the simian?
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
You're kidding.
Tell me what?
"More importantly, was I any good?"
You're okay there?
Can you hear that?
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
What?
Ah!
"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
Okay.
Yes?
"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory."
They do?
I just wan't to...
"You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
"Yeah, like in a cab..."
"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft."
"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
"Hey, big..."
...spender.
"Hey, Rach, can I get..."
Not yet.
"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
God?
"Uh, Julie."
What?
What've you been up to?
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
"So, let's go."
"No, I got him."
"Oh, seriously you want him?"
Hello.
"OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?"
"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up."
"Oh, so that's what this is for."
"And, a lemon lime."
"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
"Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done."
"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
You want me to wear your panties?
Joey?
Joey!
"Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes."
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
"No, no, this is the first time."
"I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them."
"No, no, you don't have to see."
"Alright, one of you give me your underpants."
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
"Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say."
"Ya know, the man's got a point."
"I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's."
"What am I gonna do, huh?"
"Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes."
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Ohh yes.
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
"Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin."
Waaa-aaah.
"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
Well then maybe you should take it.
"So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?"
Thanks.
"Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house."
Hey.
"Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room."
"Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare."
Morning.
"Oh, ooh."
What?
"Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good."
See ya.
There's another carton right over there.
"Alright, so what's it about?"
Well I like both eggs equally.
"Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?"
"Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch."
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
"Phoebs, play with meeee."
"Oh, oh, c'mon in."
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Why?
I can't sleep now.
I didn't realize that.
GET OUT NOW!!
I want you out.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Daaahhhh!
"Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching."
May I help you?
"Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?"
"I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate."
"Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man."
Welcome home man.
Absolutely.
"Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?"
What just happened?
"That, that is funny. Can I have it back?"
"Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?"
"Ok so, can I have my hat back?"
"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor."
"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
"Ooh, oh, oh, that's her."
Taste it.
"Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
Excuse me. Hi.
"I mean, I was sitting there."
"But, I never left the room!"
"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip."
She said she'd call me.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
"Hello, Janice."
"Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
No. Not anymore.
"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
Here in Chelsea.
"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
"No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!"
I do NOT want this unit!!
"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around."
"Okay, on three. One....Two...."
"Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
You okay?
"Knock, knock."
"Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
I just saw Janice.
"Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me."
"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?"
I like her.
"Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room."
"Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle."
"No, really you're gonna freeze."
"Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness."
"Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?"
Well hello!
The doctor.
"Okay, that hurt us."
"Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?"
What time is it now?
"Yeah all right, so we'll hang out."
Yes. Vividly.
"Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so..."
"Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
She was kidding.
"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
"Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there...."
"Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
"Okay, that's like the least fun game ever."
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
No!! You can't!!
"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!"
Look man!
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
Or... Dick.
Hey.
No!!
"No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a..."
"So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?"
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
"Yeah, well, lucky for you."
"Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!"
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
No. No!
"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
"Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself."
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
No!
With extra pulp?
No!
"No, we'd just like to close them."
Hi!
"That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him."
All right.
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
"Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
Really?!
"99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time."
Hey!
You-you do?
Yeah. Right.
What?
"No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!"
"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?"
"I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him."
"Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn."
What?!
"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
"Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there."
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
"He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago."
Yeah.
"Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!"
"I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
I don't know exactly.
"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
What?
"I am, I'm ignoring you."
"Oh, what the hell is that?"
"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
"Morning, Ross."
"Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you."
"Oh yea yea, absolutely."
Hey.
I'm not seeing Monica.
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
Well?
Look at this!
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!"
"Hey, I've been honing!"
"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
What?!
"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
What are you doing here?
"...I'm, I'm okay."
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
Hey.
"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry."
Oh my God!
Oh my... God?
I think they get it.
Morning.
"Nope, not this time."
Hey!
"No, Janice."
"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
"Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters."
I want you to say that you like her!
What are you guys doing together?
Okay.
Oh God!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
"Oh, I'll go out and get you some."
"Well, like father, like son."
"Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?"
Bad dream?
I did! I absolutely did!
"Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry."
"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time."
I have no idea.
All finished!
"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
"Oh, God."
You must stop!
Well there you go.
"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
Weird world. Your kids?
"Uh, if you say so sir."
"Well, I'm going to kill you."
"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up."
All right I'll have one.
What?
All right.
Hey.
"Yes, I realise that."
"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
"Oh, well give me the phone then."
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
"It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time."
"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
"The food there was, was great."
So take care.
Noo!
"Yeah, o-okay."
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
"You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
"All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it."
"You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
"Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe."
What happened?!!
That I did. That I did.
My duties?  All right.
I see.
Good to know.
No don t I beg of you!
Really?!
Do I ever.
No way!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Can I get a beer.
You betcha!
"Um-mm, yeah right!"
"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
The whole thing! Can we go?
"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
"Great! Okay, here."
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And
I'm back.
"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
"Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this"
"That s great, but shouldn t you be on the toilet right now?"
What s wrong with you?
That s a hernia.
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
"Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she s gonna know."
What a baby.
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
No they didn t!
"Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
I couldn t do it.
"Hey, relax I just need more time. We re going to dinner tonight."
"No, that was Dana Caplin."
"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!"
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was"
"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
"If I see him, I ll ask."
Yeah!
We re on a semi-first name basis.
"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don t know if he has what it takes."
But this is eleven. It s almost twice as hard up here.
What?
You can t wear that! I m wearing the famous tux! James Bond s tux!
So If you wear that you ll make mine less special.
Yeah!
"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
That's it?
"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
"Y'know, I, I really don t think we need a canoe."
"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
No.
Hey.
She?
"I don t know.  I can t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
Excuse me?
I don t even know the man. Okay? We re not that close. I haven t seen him in years.
It s not like we run in the same circles.
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
I ve got canned goods.
"Excellent hole, Joe."
Y know I m-I m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Y know I was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
That s me! Come on!
"Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
No!
Ohhh!!
"Uh, you ve had a lot of sex right?"
"Well, it s just the reason that I m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn t ."
It s happened to you?
"Well, what d you do?"
"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
"Young! You re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
Exactly.
It s not a real game! I made it up!
Okay.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
I don't have a page.
"So, rocks."
What does a guy have to
"Hey, I've been honing!"
"Oh, uh.."
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Yuh-huh.
"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear."
"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
You think we're ready for something like that?
"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
I'm not moving out.
"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
"Aw, don't do that"
Oh no-no-no.
"Well, y know I m 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
"Oh, I don t know."
Or Casey.
Could be Casey.
Consider Casey.
I just saw Janice.
"Well, that s pretty much all I m looking for from these people."
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What?!
That s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
F-hah.... flennin....
"Well, let s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
And protected them from a tornado?
"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
"Oh, I don t think I ever heard that story."
"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts"
Hey!
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
Why?
What's your point?
"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457."
"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
"No, no, no."
"Uh, uh."
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
No reason.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
"All right, look, you re not really gonna buy that are you? Don t you think you ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
How can I answer that when I m pretending I don t know you?
"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y know, you re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
"It s a nickname, I ll explain later."
"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
"You-you-you didn t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!"
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?"
Fine! Maybe I will too!
What?!
"Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?"
I can t figure out what to make Monica.
I m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
"No, I don t want to tell anybody else because I don t want Monica to find out."
"Well, it s because I trust you, you re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
Me too.
Hey.
Oh all right.
"Oh well, we don t because we got the other pl-place."
Ugh.

"Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
Okay.
It still doesn t work.
"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I m"
Love
"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
I m the ruptured spleen.
Because you shouldn t be with him.  You should be with me.
"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!"
"I know you probably don t want to go out with me, y know because I make too many jokes and I ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I m not technically a ""doctor """
"No, there were two."
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah man.  Joey.
Oh.
"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
Yeah but you don t need  What is this?

The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said"
So? What? What? They re gone! Monica s gonna freak!
Great.
"Oh come on Ross, I think we re all losers here."
Let me think. Let me think Oh! I don t care.
"Either, it makes no difference."
I ll take a card.
I don t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Am I naked again?!
"Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?"
"Oh right, your allergies.  All her, she hates you."
"Nope! Because I m not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?"
I found a dried up seashores.
"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
"Oh yeah, that sounds great.  Oh, and listen, it s, it s gonna be...."
All right I ll have one.
"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now."
"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
"Eh, y'know what, she s to political, she probably wouldn t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she s too international, y'know she s never gonna be around."
"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who s gonna be in the country like all the time."
"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
I'm fine.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
How do you do that?
We should always always break up together.
It doesn t matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
Not 700 exactly?
Double it!
"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
"Hey, I didn t make up the rules."
"Joey, why is your cable out?"
"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?"
"Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of style what did you throw away?"
"Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?"
"All right look, I m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
Nooo.
Hardest thing I ve ever done in my life.
Oh!
Really?
Mazel tov!
"Oh, that s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!"
...And what did you bring?
"Hey, it's Janice."
We are bad people.
"Monica, that was also true an"
What?
They put you in jail?
"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
It was the ring!
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
I can t seem to say goodbye.
Well I ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
"No, because you re not a grandmother!"
"No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.."
"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
"Oh,"
And...?
Eh
My friend s name is Joey.
The nerve huh?
Refill?
"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor s Guild."
"""Benefits lapsed."""
"Okay, it s not a check. They re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn t work enough last year."
All right.
"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
No.
Okay.

"Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!"
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!

Oh I m sorry! Do you need a break?
I can see it from right here. It ll cost you one husband.
No. We were in the middle of sex and
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Your thoughts? Plural?
"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
Great novels?
"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached"
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.

Really?! I-I thought you weren t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
"Ummmmmmmm, no."
"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
That's right.
"Oh, that's"
Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!
"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Are you serious?
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps She knows!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
"All right, call it in the air."
Heads it is.
We have to assign heads to something.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
I m not getting into this again!
"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay."
"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let s go."
"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y know?"
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we re up at the altar and I m like this."
Yeah?
Really?
"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the"
"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel."
"The actor playing Mac couldn t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o clock."
"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!"
So I have a flaw!
"So you might say, it s a magic ring."
"Oh, don t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
Just act like you belong.
Shh!  Nice to see you again.
"Yes, of course."
"Oh that s all right, I have it memorized. It s 1A."
Okay.
How did you know?
"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
"No,"
"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
"Oh please, could she"
"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!"
"Come on Monica, it s our Valentine s Day. Please? Please-please, please?"
Okay.
Let her know I like her?
"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
What about the birds?
You pick one.
"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!"
That was amazing.
"No, you're the best."
"No, you're the best."
"Hey, this isn t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
Why? What happened to him?
"Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve."
I don't think so.
Here just take this.
"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
"Oh, well thank you in advance."
Oh that s right. It s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
So apparently we just don t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?
Whose is it?
Yes.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
It's your timer.
"All right, then massage me up right nice!"
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Good-bye muscles!!
Bamboozled?
Okay.
You mean this.
"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!"
Okay.
"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
Really?!
Thanks.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
"Well, you-you know what I meant."
So what job did you get Joe?
It just keeps getting worse and worse!
"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was"
"Sorry, I just can t sleep."
"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
Yes please.
He's a he?
"Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?"
8. 8!
"If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!"
"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary  Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together."
"Really? Okay, so"
"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Right!
"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."

"I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date..."
I think it just fell off.
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
Do not speak ill of the dead.
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
 Kay!
"Uhh, no."
No.
Yes.
Okay man.
"It s a funny story, actually."
"But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain t that funny?"
No no no!
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it s romantic, but because I can!"
Oh yes!
Okay.
No! No! No! No  one can beat me.
"I am sorry, but some of us have to"
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Let me see the earrings.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
That was Joey!
"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
Okay.
Secret? Married people aren t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
"No I m serious, we should tell each other"
"Oh no-no, I can t do that."
Okay.
"So, Ross and I are going to"
"No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe s secret?"

"Well, you re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes"
Do you wanna?
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
"But, we ll stay here with you."
"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that."
"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you."
"Well, Chandler will be there for you too."
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
What? Why?
"Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?"
"Goin  out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
What?
Wait! You re going out with Kathy!
"Well, I m upset for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs."
"All right look, I think it s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Oh!
I think that s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
And people say you don t pay attention.
That s what I do now.
"Oh-no, he s right."
"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
"Janice s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
Why not?!
What is the thing?
What?
"Well she, she wouldn t do that, she s with, she s with me."
Pheebs!!

"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life."
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
"I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
"No! No! Not, Paris."
"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That s right, yes, I m being transferred to Yemen!"
I don t know exactly.
But I do know that it s some time tomorrow.
"Oh, listen."
"No. When it comes to sweets, he s surprisingly strict."
"No, no, I keep trying, y know?"
All right.
What d you rent?
"Joey, this is"
"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
I stole Monica s and changed the name.
"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
"Oh yeah! Okay, let s play again.  What do you got?"
You re kidding right?
Well that s a full cup!
"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don t want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
"Well, we don t want that."
But we should take it.

"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
"Hey, I can be smooth."
Okay.
Is there any chance you didn t see that?
Oh no thanks. I don t like

Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Ow!
"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!"
Well it's not flexed right now!
"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain."
"Now, there s two reasons."
"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"
"Uhh yeah. Yeah, it s  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?"
"Okay Bob listen uhh, I m the reason you didn t get the job up here."
Bob!
What are you doing here?
Then what?
You ve got it.

I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
My lighter s in there!
"Yeah, I know but"
"Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
"Oh, the mixed tape."
He's open!
"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
Okay.
"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her."
"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head."
You said...
"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
"Look, we ve always talked about having babies someday."
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
"Look, Monica"
This is not going to work.
You are so great! I love you!
"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
No I didn't!
No I didn't!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

"Yeah, I do."
"Oh, all right."
What a wank!
"I just came over to drop off nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?"
"So, I guess this is over."
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
We're in a relationship?
Okay.
"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
There's a forest right outside.
"Ok, go quick!"
"Oh, come on! I don t care! Come on! Whose is it?"
Not once did we do that.
Hey!

It s Clint. It s Clint!
"Ow, no  woo-hooing,  no  woo-hooing. "
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey s sister.  Well, that s not the worst part."
I can t remember which sister.
"C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!"
"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.."
"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it."
Chicks don t swim.
I don t know. Should we try it?
"See, I told you they don t swim."
"Noo!  Oh, it s okay, it s okay, baby, baby, baby."
Well it s very unsettling.
"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Really stupid.
"All right, let me in."
What?
It's throwing and catching!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh"
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend."
"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I ll see you later."
"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!"
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let s discuss it before we reject it completely."""
"So, that s it?"
Which is why
"I don t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
"No, I m not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room."
I don't know.
That's
"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."
No!
Janice!
"Well, I then guess I m going to Yemen! I m going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
Brenda a bee!
Yes! It s flown into your blouse and you d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
You do?
I totally understand.  Can I
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
Dude! Dude!
"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00."
That s what Monica said.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
I would really love it if I could do both.
What?
What?!
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
"Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk."
"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
You mean scared.
No. No! No! No!
You can t leave! I have your shoe!
"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way."
Oh uh well tomorrow s no good for her either.
It s the semi-finals of her botchy ball tournament.
Well now-now you re just talking crazy.
Because uh we-we we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
"Joey, you have to tell her what s going on! And what did it  look like?!"
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
"Okay, look, just do it gently."
See that s where I think that you re wrong. We ve been playing these babies man for man. we should really be playing a zone defense.
"Uh, what was that?"
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
That s a mailman! That s
"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?"
"No, the little girl creeps me out."
Why would the baby creep me out?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven s, let meet at seven, not at six."
What?!
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
"We share a wall! So either he s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
Yeah?
Hey!
Okay. And it s not just chicks y'know? It s all kinds of other animals!
"Thanks, I m glad you see it that way."
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
Because I'm very happy for him!  And
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really"
"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I m-I m talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name."
"Ginger. I m talking to Ginger, so...."
"Nope, nope, I d just ah, I d rather talk to you."
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with."
"I m never gonna find a roommate, ever."
"Well let s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that s plural."
Two.
"Oh, y know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
"Well, I don t really know what that is, but"
"Okay, hating this."
"Oh, sure, they love us over there."
Joey... Switzerland?
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
Might wanna try Joseph.
"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof."
I sure did.
"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!"
Hi.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
What are you guys doing?
"Oooh, I m afraid that does not exist."
"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who s going like this"
"I don t know what it is, I just can t take a good picture."
"Yeah, I m not in that."
"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
"""Smoke away."""
"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
"Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!"
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room."
Then what?
"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
"Alright. Yes, this is Rachel."
Yuh-huh.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Here we go.
"Hey, Janice."
What... did you get me there?
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
That's it?
"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
How do you do that?
We should always always break up together.
"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!"
"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy."
"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks."
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Put Joey on the phone.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
WHAT IS IT?!
"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
What?
You knew about this?
"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
I can't believe you did this.
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
You think we're ready for something like that?
"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
"Rachel, wait, wait."
Can I just say one thing?
"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
"Hey, it's Janice."
"No, no, no!"
"Oh, okay. Send her in."
"Hi, Nina. Come on in."
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
And?
So what does this mean?
"Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;"
"Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me."
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
"Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us."
"Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise."
"Sure, why not?"
"Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?"
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
"Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk."
"Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
And your friend Phoebe?
"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
"You know, you think I would."
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
"No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
"Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad."
"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : ""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"""
"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
Joey... Switzerland?
Might wanna try Joseph.
"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
Wow!
"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate."
"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
What?
Ah!
"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
Okay.
Bye bye.
Ooh.
What?
I just wan't to...
But I just wa...
"Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend."
"Okay, hating this."
"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
... And where's this money coming from?
...spender.
So how'd it go?
Not yet.
"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
God?
"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
"Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright."
Bob here.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I'm back.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this."
"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
"Oh, seriously you want him?"
Hello.
"Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
"Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?"
"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
"So, you feel like goin' for a run?"
Who said anything about Christmas?
Yeah.
And last but not least.
"Oh, yeah."
"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
"OK, then, eat me, I'm done."
"Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell."
Joey!
"Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes."
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
"No, no, this is the first time."
"I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them."
"No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever."
"Alright, one of you give me your underpants."
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
"That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy."
Chandler.
Hey.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Congratulations!
Do we dare?
Hey.
It's the Miracle Wax.
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Fine with me.
Thanks.
"Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so."
Yeah.
"Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today."
"Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare."
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
"Oh it's uh, over there on the table."
What?
"Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good."
See ya.
"Oh, I couldn't be happier."
"Alright, so what's it about?"
Well I like both eggs equally.
"Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?"
"Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch."
You don't like that show?
"Oh o-, OK man."
We don't need to remedy that.
Oh.
Why?
I can't sleep now.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
GET OUT NOW!!
Yes please.
Where did you hear it from before?
"Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?"
"Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching."
Uuuh.
"Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?"
"I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate."
"Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man."
"Well I, I think we'd remember something like that."
Absolutely.
Ah that's a cantelope.
"No actually, I was just going for colorful."
"That, that is funny. Can I have it back?"
No?
"No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page."
Huh.
"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Oh my God!
"Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
"Hey, mister tux!"
"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
"But, I never left the room!"
"All right, that's it, give me your underwear."
"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip."
"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
Oh God.
"So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
"Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
No. Not anymore.
"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
Here in Chelsea.
A woman's
"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Yeah!
I do NOT want this unit!!
Fine!
"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time."
Why two?
"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
Right.
"Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
Okay. It's a racecar.
You totally screwed him over.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
"Sure, everybody loves a kidder."
"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them."
"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
"Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."
"Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'"
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
"Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people."
"Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle."
"Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
"You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
"Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
"You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?"
The doctor.
"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting."
"Well ah, ........y'know."
What time is it now?
"Yeah all right, so we'll hang out."
Yes. Vividly.
"Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so..."
"Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
She was kidding.
"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
"Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there...."
"Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
"Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you."
"Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
My lighter's in there!
Well it's very unsettling.
"Oh. Nope, that patch is no good."
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!"
Look man!
Listen to me!!
"No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man."
What about things that are already gold?
Hey.
Was it like a sneeze only better?
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
"Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
"Yeah, well, lucky for you."
I don't know.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Could we be more white trash?
"Well, not at first."
"Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself."
"Okay, I promise, I'll end it."
Freedom!
With extra pulp?
No!
"Oh no, you'll have to come."
I wanna quit the bank!
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Is it on?
All right.
"Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
Okay.
Right in there!
Hey!
"Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
You got me.
Okay.
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
"Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?"
"I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him."
"Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn."
I-I think we have too.
"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?"
What?
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
"Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
"Actually, me too."
I know!!
"No! No! Not, Paris."
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
You slept with the stripper?
"Oh, what the hell is that?"
"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
"Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?"
Yeah you are!!
"Oh yea yea, absolutely."
I don't want to look.
I'm not seeing Monica.
What?
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Look at this!
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
"Hey, I've been honing!"
"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
What are you doing here?
"...I'm, I'm okay."
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
Okay.
"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry."
Oh my God!
Oh my... God?
"So, what're you gonna do?"
There's the man.
"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
I'm not yanking you.
Of!
"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
"Well, there you go."
I want you to say that you like her!
"Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
Really.
Oh God!
Really?
Hey.
No way!
Okay. It's a chicken.
I found a dried up seashores.
"Ummmmmmmm, no."
"I'm not Jewish, so..."
"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?"
"I'm sure you're right, but why?"
I know! I know!
F-hah.... flennin....
"If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
All finished!
"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
"Oh, God."
Oh my God!
Stay out of my freezer!
"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
Weird world. Your kids?
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
"Well, I'm going to kill you."
Why?
"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife."
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
"Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me."
I talked to Janice.
"Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem."
That's the stuff!
"Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!"
"Oh, well give me the phone then."
"Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'"
"That's just a lot of big talk, y'know."
"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
"The food there was, was great."
So take care.
"Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime."
"Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
"You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
"All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it."
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
"Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe."
"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Do I ever.
No way!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Can I get a beer.
You betcha!
"What, what, what?!"
"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
The whole thing! Can we go?
"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
"That s great, but shouldn t you be on the toilet right now?"
What s wrong with you?
This sounds like a hernia. You have to you-you go to the doctor!
That s a hernia.
"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do""."
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
I
So what are you gonna do?
You are beautiful.
Call it even?!
Here you go.
"No, no, you re right, it is a ridiculous name!"
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
"Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
I couldn t do it.
"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
What?
You can t wear that! I m wearing the famous tux! James Bond s tux!
"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
Hey.
She?
"I don t know.  I can t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
Excuse me?
"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that s because I didn t send him an invitation."
I don t even know the man. Okay? We re not that close. I haven t seen him in years.
What?
"Excellent hole, Joe."
Y know I m-I m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Y know I was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
That s me! Come on!
"Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
What problem did you tell him you had?
Joe?
"Uh, you ve had a lot of sex right?"
It s happened to you?
"Well, what d you do?"
"Take whatever you want, just please don t hurt me."
"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
Exactly.
It s not a real game! I made it up!
Dangerous Liaisons
Okay.
I respectfully disagree.
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
I don't have a page.
"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?"
"So, rocks."
"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Yuh-huh.
"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
You think we're ready for something like that?
"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
I'm not moving out.
"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
"Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
Oh no-no-no.
"Well, y know I m 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
"Oh, I don t know."
You mean with Casey.
Or Casey.
Could be Casey.
Consider Casey.
I like her.
"Oh, that's Ross's."
F-hah.... flennin....
I m marrying her.
So what was it for anyway?
"Well, let s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
When did that happen to you?!
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
No.
Hey!
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
Why?
"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
"No, no, no."
"Uh, uh."
"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
"Well, I don t have to buy that, ""I m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
"All right, look, you re not really gonna buy that are you? Don t you think you ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
Look at this!
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
Where ya going?
What?!
"Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?"
I can t figure out what to make Monica.
I m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon."
"Wait a minute, I can t give this to her."
"No, I don t want to tell anybody else because I don t want Monica to find out."
"Well, it s because I trust you, you re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
"Oh well, we don t because we got the other pl-place."
What?
You slept with the stripper?
You don t think I ve tried? You think I
"Oh Maria. You can t say no to her, she s like this lycra spandex covered gym treat."
No!
"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
Umm?
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
The key s stuck in the lock.
"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I m"
How long have we been home?
"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
I m the ruptured spleen.
Because you shouldn t be with him.  You should be with me.
"I know you probably don t want to go out with me, y know because I make too many jokes and I ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I m not technically a ""doctor """
"No, there were two."
Hi there.
"All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?"
Okay.
"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Yeah but you don t need  What is this?
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said"
So you don t have the cameras?!
So? What? What? They re gone! Monica s gonna freak!
Great.
This game makes no sense!
Let me think. Let me think Oh! I don t care.
"Either, it makes no difference."
I ll take a card.
This game is kinda fun.
Am I naked again?!
"Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?"
"Oh, I ll go out and get you some."
Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
"Oh yeah, that sounds great.  Oh, and listen, it s, it s gonna be...."
I'm free! I'm free!
"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
"So, let's go."
"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
"Eh, y'know what, she s to political, she probably wouldn t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who s gonna be in the country like all the time."
"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
I'm fine.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
How do you do that?
We should always always break up together.
Not 700 exactly?
Double it!
"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
I m an alien. I m an alien.
Oh you ve got to be kidding me.
"What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?"
"Joey, why is your cable out?"
"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?"
Whoa ho.
Paid your phone bill?
"Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land."
"All right look, I m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
Nooo.
Hardest thing I ve ever done in my life.
Oh!
Really?
Oh yeah! With who?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
And you re our age. You re our age.
That s not a state Joe.
"Monica, that was also true an"
"Oh, that s uh, that s pretty nice but I m gonna go with the one I picked first."
What?
They put you in jail?
"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
You re building a post office?
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
I can t seem to say goodbye.
Well I ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Y know what? Forget it!
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
"Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
"No, because you re not a grandmother!"
"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
"You gotta do it, man."
I don't think so!
"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
"Oh,"
And...?
"Yeah, well  Y know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
Eh
"Ring dammit, ring!"
What?!
"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor s Guild."
"""Benefits lapsed."""
"Okay, it s not a check. They re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn t work enough last year."
All right.
"I m sorry man, there s never a good time to  stop catching on fire."
"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
No.
"Yeah, well, you re wrong! Okay, you re wrong."
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Here it is! Here it is!
It's a four.
Oh I m sorry! Do you need a break?
I can see it from right here. It ll cost you one husband.
Do you know what just happened?
No. We were in the middle of sex and
Hey Pheebs!
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Your thoughts? Plural?
"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
Great novels?
Now that Rachel's gone?
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
What are you doing here?
We got some
He s taking off her coat!
"Well, like father, like son."
Really?! I-I thought you weren t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
"Ummmmmmmm, no."
That's right.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
"Oh, that's"
Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!
"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Are you serious?
"Joey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Yes. Yes.
It happened in London.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
"All right, call it in the air."
Heads it is.
We have to assign heads to something.
"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that s as good as garbage?"
What?
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Well you did pull his hair.
I m not getting into this again!
"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay."
I think that s gum.
"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let s go."
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we re up at the altar and I m like this."
"Well, either that or uh"
My favorite part was when
"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel."
"To the left, to the left- aww!"
Please tell me you got the message!
"The actor playing Mac couldn t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o clock."
"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
"Oh, don t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
You left a shoe here?!
"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I ll be sure to give him your shoe."
No.
Just act like you belong.
I do?
Okay.
Here I am.
"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!"
"Come on Monica, it s our Valentine s Day. Please? Please-please, please?"
That's patio furniture!
What about the birds?
You pick one.
"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
That was amazing.
"No, you're the best."
"No, you're the best."
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
Why? What happened to him?
Let's go!
"Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve."
I don't think so.
Here just take this.
"Your liking it, huh?"
Okay.
"Oh, well thank you in advance."
Whose is it?
Really?
Yes.
So I really never get to win anymore?
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
The British are coming?
Ohh.
"Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!"
It's your timer.
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
You ll be perfect for this! That s already your name!
Bamboozled?
Hello children!
Okay.
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
You mean this.
"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!"
Much
"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
Really?!
Thanks.
"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!"
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was"
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
"Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?"
8. 8!
"That, that's what's stupid."
"Really? Okay, so"
"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Oh my God!
Really?
Ohh.
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
Do not speak ill of the dead.
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y know, technically we still"
"Uhh, no."
No.
Yes.
Okay man.
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it s romantic, but because I can!"
"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000."
Oh yes!
Okay.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Let me see the earrings.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
"Okay, here we go."
No!
That was Joey!
"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
Really?
Okay.
"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
Secret? Married people aren t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
"No I m serious, we should tell each other"
"Oh no-no, I can t do that."
Okay.
"So, Ross and I are going to"
"No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe s secret?"
That s it?! I gave up my
"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Why is your family
"Listen, I ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
Would you tell her I let you win please?
Oh what s the matter? Are you scared?
Right here!
Okay.
"Yes, if it really doesn t mean anything, because you know that I m just not ready"
Okay.
Totally.
"Yeah, it s beautiful."
"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
"Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can t believe that I ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
"Well, you re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes"
Do you wanna?
You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I ll be living here.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
"Hey man, how did the audition go?"
"But, we ll stay here with you."
Really?
"Well, thanks a lot for hookin  me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
Oh my God!
What? Why?
Uh-huh.
"Goin  out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
What?
Wait! You re going out with Kathy!
"Well, I m upset for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
"All right look, I think it s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
Oh!  She s growing inside you.
Oh!
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Joe
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you re still gonna date him?
"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
"Janice s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
"That s a good idea,  Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday . I would like to get her something serious."
"All right. Look, I m gonna go in here, and you don t buy me anything ever."
Why not?!
What is the thing?
What?
Pheebs!!
"Okay, I'll stop."
You wanna play?
"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
I'm intrigued.
"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
"No. When it comes to sweets, he s surprisingly strict."
"Oh, so that s this is gonna work now? You re just gonna order me around all the time?"
What d you rent?
"Joey, this is"
"Yeah, I just got uh, got plans."
You didn t just break up.
I stole Monica s and changed the name.
"Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba."
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
"Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?"
"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
"Oh yeah! Okay, let s play again.  What do you got?"
You re kidding right?
Well that s a full cup!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don t want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
"Well, we don t want that."
But we should take it.
Why?
"Well, you're gonna."
"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
Yeah. I really do.
Yes that would have made more sense.
See you later.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Hi! Bye!
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?"
Give him money? It was a joke!
"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
"Well it s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories."
"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny."
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Ow!
"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!"
But you found the keys to his clothes?
"I m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!"
I m not even  I m not even
"Thank you, Joey."
"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"
How do you figure that?
Then what?
"So in your whole life, you've only been with one  oh."
"Okay, absolutely!"
You ve got it.
As in Barbara Streisand s husband James Brolin?
"Y know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren t they?"
"Yeah, I know but"
"Okay, okay, but don t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,"
"Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
"Oh, the mixed tape."
"Wait a minute, hold the phone! You re not Elizabeth s dad?!"
"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
Okay.
"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
You said...
"Oh, yeah?"
"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
We really need to take those tests?
"Damn those robots, they re supposed to be our"
I m not crazy about babies. I m crazy about us.
"Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Hello.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
"Look, Monica"
This is not going to work.
You are so great! I love you!
"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
No I didn't!
No I didn't!
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
"Well, why don t you tell her to stop being silly!"
That s laughter.
"Yeah, I do."
"I just came over to drop off nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?"
"So, I guess this is over."
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
"So, this isn't over?"
Really? Okay. Great!
We're in a relationship?
What?
"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
There's a forest right outside.
"Ok, go quick!"
"Oh, come on! I don t care! Come on! Whose is it?"
"Look, I m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
"Oh yeah? Well, how d she take it?"
"Uhh, 9."
"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing."
"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go."
"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Okay. All right.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
"So you uh, want to do something tonight?"
"Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?"
I bet he can.
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
Yeah!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to you-you Go to the doctor!
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Oh I m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
The reason he just said.
"C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!"
Having a swim.
Chicks don t swim.
I don t know. Should we try it?
"See, I told you they don t swim."
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
What?
It's throwing and catching!
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let s discuss it before we reject it completely."""
"So, that s it?"
Which is why
"I don t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
I don't know.
"He s not gonna make it, he s stuck in Chicago."
Dude! Dude!
"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00."
That s what Monica said.
I would really love it if I could do both.
What?
What?!
"Joey, you have to tell her what s going on! And what did it  look like?!"
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
"Okay, look, just do it gently."
"Oh, it s okay. I don t"
"Uh, what was that?"
"Yes, Bunny?"
Could've been a peach.
"I think it s great. It s great. Y know, they re thinking of changing the name of this place."
To Put the Camera Away!!!
That s a mailman! That s
"No, the little girl creeps me out."
Why would the baby creep me out?
This is going in your book?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Really?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
We said seven!
"The only way that I said six would be if the seven s, let meet at seven, not at six."
Oh my good God.
What?!
"We share a wall! So either he s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
Okay. And it s not just chicks y'know? It s all kinds of other animals!
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
"Umm, how s it going with you guys?"
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here."
"Okay, hating this."
You know it?
"Oh, sure, they love us over there."
Joey... Switzerland?
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
Might wanna try Joseph.
"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
So what does this mean?
Hang on buddy!
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth
Yeah! You wanna come?
"Oooh, I m afraid that does not exist."
"Yeah, I m not in that."
"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
"Yes, Bunny?"
Could've been a peach.
"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
Then what?
"So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh."
"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
"Alright. Yes, this is Rachel."
"To the left, to the left- aww!"
"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Yuh-huh.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Here we go.
"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
How do you do that?
We should always always break up together.
"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!"
"Hey, it's me."
"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
What?
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
I can't believe you did this.
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
You gotta let me slam the door!
"And, we're done with the yogurt."
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
You think we're ready for something like that?
I'm not moving out.
I'm sorry!
"Rachel, wait, wait."
Can I just say one thing?
"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
"Well, you're gonna."
What? What?
Any contact?
I think it's winning.
"Well, only if you order stuff."
And your friend Phoebe?
"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
"No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : ""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"""
"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?"
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
Might wanna try Joseph.
"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
So what does this mean?
"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
You're kidding.
"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate."
You're okay there?
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
What?
Ah!
"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
Okay.
I just wan't to...
But I just wa...
"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here."
"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
... And where's this money coming from?
What about the time difference?
...spender.
Not yet.
God?
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
"Hey, sweetums."
"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there."
"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
"So, let's go."
I can't believe the guys missed this.
"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
"Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself."
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
